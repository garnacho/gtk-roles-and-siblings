Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.3.1:

* GTK+ now uses the Pango library for text manipulation. All
  strings in GTK+ now are in Unicode, languages written
  from right-to-left, and complex-text languages are now supported.
* The gdk-pixbuf library for image loading and manipulation is 
  has been integrated with GTK+.
* The GTK+ object system has mostly been moved to GLib, separating
  it from the GUI code. Many significant enhancements have been
  made as part of this.
* A new text widget is now included. This started as a port
  of the Tk text widget, and includes such features of the Tk
  text widget as tags, marks, and unicode text support. It
  has been enhanced to support model-view operation and the
  full power of Pango.
* The GDK library has been extensively revised to support multiple
  windowing systems. The only fully functional backend in 1.3.1
  is the X11 backend, however, ports to Win32, Linux-framebuffer,
  Nano-X, BeOS, and MacOS exist in various states of completion,
  and at least some of these will be finished and integrated in 
  before the final GTK+-2.0 release.
* 32-bit coordinates are now supported throughout GDK and GTK+
  (they are emulated where not supported by the windowing system.)
* Many minor bug fixes and enhancements. Incompatible changes
  are documented in docs/Changes-2.0.txt

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.8:

* GNU Make 3.79 bug workaround
* FAQ and tutorial updates and improvements
* Miscellaneous bug fixes: CList, Calendar, rc-files, FontSelection

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.7:

* More header cleanups.
* Fixed activation bug for insensitive widgets.
* Locale fixes to RC file parsing code.
* Miscellaneous bugfixes for Item Factory, CList, CTree, X Selections,
  HScale, VScale, Pixmap, Viewport, OptionMenu, Entry and Notebook.
* Upgrade to libtool 1.3.4.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.6:

* container queue_resize fixes
* gtk[vh]scale: minor fixups
* rename idle to idle_id in testgtk to avoid conflicts with 
  broken libs
* More consistant naming of gtkrc files
* Added language support: ro, uk

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.5:

* more GtkCTree and GtkWindow bug fixes.
* more redraw/resize queue fixes, better expose event
  discarding code.
* more miscellaneous bugs fixed
* new configure.in option --disable-rebuilds to completely disable
  rebuilds of autogenerated sources.
* check for 5.002 now, to avoid failing autogeneration build rules due
  to old perl versions.
* fonts (and fontsets) are cached now.
* more autogeneration make rules and dependancy fixups, we should be
  save with autogeneration up to make -j12 now ;)
* new window position GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER_ALWAYS, which will recenter the
  GtkWindow on every size change.
* major rework of window manager hints handling code, fixed a bunch of
  races with the new resizing code.
* the new wm hints and resizing code is absolutely perfect and bug free now,
  it only lacks testing ;)
* fixed up various rc style memory prolems.
* gtk_widget_modify_style() now properly changes the style of realized widgets
  and references the style passed into it. if people worked around this bug,
  this will introduce a slight memory leak in their code.
  The code should typically look like:
            GtkRcStyle *rc_style = gtk_rc_style_new ();
            [...]
            gtk_widget_modify_style (widget, rc_style);
            gtk_rc_style_unref (rc_style);
* fix problems with positioning menus offscreen.
* GtkText fixes for some crashes and drawing errors.
* Better handling for unexpected window destroys in GDK and GTK+.
  This should make it possible to use a GtkPlug and catch the
  case where its parent socket is randomly killed.
* FAQ updates.
* FileSelection i18n patches, RadioButton fixups.
* many translation improvements.
* miscellaneous other bugs fixed.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.4:

* DnD improvements (drags can be canceled with Esc now).
* suppressed configure event reordering in Gdk.
* rewrite of Gtk's configure event handling.
* major improvements for the object argument system (Elena Devdariani).

* Bug fixes and leak plugs for the Gdk IM code.
* Added gtk_object_get() facility to retrive object arguments easily.
  The var args list expects ("arg-name", &value) pairs.
* Fixed mapping for GdkInputCondition<->GIOCondition, this should fix
  problems where closed pipes were no longer signalling GDK_INPUT_READ on
  systems with a native poll().
* Some cleanups to GtkLabel's memory allocation code (shouldn't leak memory
  anymore).
* We don't attempt to lookup xpm color "None" anymore, this should prevent
  eXodus (commercial X windows server) from popping up a color dialog every
  time a transparent pixmap is created.
* Fixed bug where Gtk timout/idle handlers would execute without the global
  Gdk lock being held.
* Other minor bug fixes.

Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.2.1:

* Many Bug fixes have been applied to the menu and accelerator code.
* GtkItemFactory can "adopt" foreign menu items now and manage their
  accelerator installation. This is often required to get GtkItemFactory
  like accelerator propagation between different windows with the same
  menu heirarchy and for centralized parsing and saving of accelerators.
* GtkCList/GtkCTree buttons should always display correctly now.
* Miscellaneous other bug fixes.

What's New in GTK+ 1.2.0 (since 1.0.x):

  widget->requisition is always what the widget requested,
  unmodified by the usize. See Changes-1.2.txt for details.
  This correct various bugs with gtk_widget_set_usize().
* Fixes for XIM on X11R5 systems
* Don't allow cut-and-paste of text in password-style entries
* --enable-debug is now on by default for the development releaes.
  (When compiling for "production", use --enable-debug=minimum)

    gtk_toggle_button_get_active()
* Some locale fixups in gtkrc code
* Fixes to make gtk_radio_button_set_group() keep only
  one radio button in the group active
* Foreign windows are now always treated as viewable; this fixes
  a problem where updating didn't occure properly in GtkPlug
* DND fixes for 64 bit architectures, and for specifying operations 
  with modifier keys.
* Major revisions to GtkLayout: avoid having to create window
  for NO_WINDOW children, adjust allocations of children as 
  scrolled so queued draws work, and a resize is queued instead
  of allocating directly in a put() or move()

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.13:

* Dnd and selection bug fixes and memory purification.
* Widget sensitivity fixups.
* Tooltips windows are now named "gtk-tooltips" so rc file rules
  can match tooltips windows. Fixed interaction of tooltips and NO_WINDOW
  widgets.
* Spin buttons now update their values upon value retrival.
* Overhaul of the resizing vs. redrawing logic to reduce redrawing needs
  a lot. Gtk makes full use of the draw_area coalescing code now, which
  got minorly improved as well.
* Containers map their Gdk windows after their children now to reduce
  expose event generation.
* Gdk event queue fixups, this solves the double-click problems people were
  recently having.
* Account for the fact that GSource's are only properly reentrant from
  within dispatch(), thus we don't do Gdk event processing from within
  check() or prepare() anymore.
* Rc files feature a bg_pixmap value of "<none>" now.
* Improved session management support in Gdk.  
* Automatic disabling of NLS if no gettext is found should work now.

  Hamann on Tue Aug 18 00:29:13 1998).
* A bunch of varargs functions changed to get va_lists working on systems that
  implement va_lists as arrays.
* Improvements to the gdkrgb code.
* Improvements to Gdk color handling so we greatly reduce server traffic and
  don't leak colors anymore.
* Improved internal widget tree iterators (the GtkContainer::foreach signal
  vanished because of this).
* Option menus can have the keyboard focus now.
* More fixups to the text widget.
* GtkFileSelection should behave much more nicely in combination with AFS now.
* Support for label underlining.
* Support for GLib 1.1.3 log domains.
* Documentation improvements.
* Configuration fixes on various platforms.
* Miscellaneous fixes to XInput support.
* Build with shared library dependencies on Linux
* Fix for a major bug in the type systems memory allocation code that could
  cause random crashes.
* Libtool update to version 1.2b.
* Lots of bugfixes and cleanups again ;)


What is new in GTK+ 1.1.1:

* Tutorial updates and additions.
* Key binding support for GtkListItems and GtkList.
* Extended selection mode and autoscrolling for GtkLists.
* A GtkCtree now operates on GtkCTreeNode* structures rather than GList*.
* GtkCTreeNodes can now be created from GNode trees.
* Bug fixes for GtkNotebook, GtkCList, GtkCombo and GdkWindow reparentation.


What is new in GTK+ 1.1.0:

* New widget GtkFontSelector.
* New featurefull progress bar.
* New container widget GtkPacker.
* New object GtkItemFactory, GtkMenuFactory is deprecated.
* New key binding system, configurable via rcfiles, similar to styles.
* New widget GtkCTree with drag selections and keyboard movement and
  and horizontal scrolling. Features also implemented for GtkCList.
* Significant speedups to widget creation and destruction through caching
  colormap and visual queries to the XServer.
* Speedups for type creation and especially gtk_type_is_a() checks.
* Speedups in signal lookup, creation and emissions and connection handling.
* Minor speedups with object data allocation and destruction.
* Additions to the signal handling API (e.g. *_emitv).
* Support for rc-file reparsing.
* Resizing logic is now implemented on container widget basis, rather than
  for toplevel GtkWindows only.
* Buttons support relief styles now.
* Some widgets are now allocated through memchunks to behave more memory wise.
* Newly included file gtkfeatures.h which defines compatibility macros to
  test for certain API features upon program compilation.
* Child arguments support for container widgets.
* Far better support for object arguments, revamp of the underlying
  mechanism for speed and reusability. Child/object arguments don't
  need to be preceeded by the "GtkType::" portion anymore.
* Removed GtkAcceleratorTable in favour of GtkAccelGroup, accelerator display
  is now performed by a new widget GtkAccelLabel.
* Overhaul of the resizing code. Resizing behaviour can now be specified
  on GtkContainer basis, so the underlying algorithm isn't only available
  for GtkWindows.
* GtkTables are now fully resizable.
* The GtkType system now supports an additional base class initialization
  function.
* GtkStyles and key bindings can now be looked up depending on the base
  types of a widget, through a new keyword `class' in rc files.
* GtkButton derives from GtkBin (finally).  
* More descriptive error messages on rc parsing.  
* Runtime information is available to query enum/flag definition values.
* Upgrade to libtool-1.2
* Legions of bug fixes, memory leaks, segfaults, of-by-something errors...
  including those that already went into the 1.0.x branch.
* A big bunch of features and cosmetic fixups that just got lost in
  the masses of changes.
