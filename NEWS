What is new in GTK+ 1.1.14:

* Additions to docs/Changes-1.2.txt
* Just warn when loading theme engine fails
* CLAMP GtkScale digits to a meaningful range
* GTK_LOCALDIR is now defined in a better fashion
* New functions (feature freeze, we know...):
    gtk_menu_set_title()
    gtk_toggle_button_get_active()
* Some locale fixups in gtkrc code
* Fixes to make gtk_radio_button_set_group() keep only
  one radio button in the group active
* Foreign windows are now always treated as viewable; this fixes
  a problem where updating didn't occure properly in GtkPlug
* DND fixes for 64 bit architectures, and for specifying operations 
  with modifier keys.
* Major revisions to GtkLayout: avoid having to create window
  for NO_WINDOW children, adjust allocations of children as 
  scrolled so queued draws work, and a resize is queued instead
  of allocating directly in a put() or move()

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.13:

* Dnd and selection bug fixes and memory purification.
* Widget sensitivity fixups.
* Tooltips windows are now named "gtk-tooltips" so rc file rules
  can match tooltips windows. Fixed interaction of tooltips and NO_WINDOW
  widgets.
* Spin buttons now update their values upon value retrival.
* Overhaul of the resizing vs. redrawing logic to reduce redrawing needs
  a lot. Gtk makes full use of the draw_area coalescing code now, which
  got minorly improved as well.
* Containers map their Gdk windows after their children now to reduce
  expose event generation.
* Gdk event queue fixups, this solves the double-click problems people were
  recently having.
* Account for the fact that GSource's are only properly reentrant from
  within dispatch(), thus we don't do Gdk event processing from within
  check() or prepare() anymore.
* Rc files feature a bg_pixmap value of "<none>" now.
* Improved session management support in Gdk.  
* Automatic disabling of NLS if no gettext is found should work now.
* Removed deprecated functions, docs/Changes-1.2.txt gives an overview.
* Gtk+ development now requires GNU autoconf 2.13, GNU automake 1.4
  and GNU libtool 1.2d.
* More bug fixes all over the place.

  for entries.

  improvement
* An environment variable GTK_MODULES which takes a colon seperated
  list of module names GTK+ will now automatically load at gtk_init() startup
* GtkFontSel now has support for an extra 'base' filter
* New function gdk_window_set_root_origin to get the real geometry taking
  into account window manager offsets

What is new in GTK+ 1.1.2:

* Gtk+ is now featuring runtime loading of dynamic modules via the
  --gtk-modules= command line switch. such modules have to export a
  G_MODULE_EXPORT void gtk_module_init (gint *argc, gchar ***argv);
  function which will be invoked to initialize the module. since such
  modules may create new widget types, they are always resident.
* The tutorial has been updated again.
* Changes to menus including tearoff menus and accelerators.
* Better support for modal dialogs.
* Removed CAN_FOCUS by default from scrollbars and button children of toolbar.
* More improvements and fixes for GtkCList and GtkCTree (i.e. row sorting).

* The GtkCTree API has undergone major renames (see ChangeLog entry from Lars
  Hamann on Tue Aug 18 00:29:13 1998).
* A bunch of varargs functions changed to get va_lists working on systems that
  implement va_lists as arrays.
* Improvements to the gdkrgb code.
* Improvements to Gdk color handling so we greatly reduce server traffic and
  don't leak colors anymore.
* Improved internal widget tree iterators (the GtkContainer::foreach signal
  vanished because of this).

* New container widget GtkPacker.
* New object GtkItemFactory, GtkMenuFactory is deprecated.
* New key binding system, configurable via rcfiles, similar to styles.
* New widget GtkCTree with drag selections and keyboard movement and
  and horizontal scrolling. Features also implemented for GtkCList.
* Significant speedups to widget creation and destruction through caching
  colormap and visual queries to the XServer.
* Speedups for type creation and especially gtk_type_is_a() checks.
* Speedups in signal lookup, creation and emissions and connection handling.
* Minor speedups with object data allocation and destruction.
* Additions to the signal handling API (e.g. *_emitv).
* Support for rc-file reparsing.
* Resizing logic is now implemented on container widget basis, rather than
  for toplevel GtkWindows only.
* Buttons support relief styles now.
* Some widgets are now allocated through memchunks to behave more memory wise.
* Newly included file gtkfeatures.h which defines compatibility macros to
  test for certain API features upon program compilation.
* Child arguments support for container widgets.
* Far better support for object arguments, revamp of the underlying
  mechanism for speed and reusability. Child/object arguments don't
  need to be preceeded by the "GtkType::" portion anymore.
* Removed GtkAcceleratorTable in favour of GtkAccelGroup, accelerator display
  is now performed by a new widget GtkAccelLabel.
* Overhaul of the resizing code. Resizing behaviour can now be specified
  on GtkContainer basis, so the underlying algorithm isn't only available
  for GtkWindows.
* GtkTables are now fully resizable.
* The GtkType system now supports an additional base class initialization
  function.
* GtkStyles and key bindings can now be looked up depending on the base
  types of a widget, through a new keyword `class' in rc files.

  including those that already went into the 1.0.x branch.
* A big bunch of features and cosmetic fixups that just got lost in
  the masses of changes.
