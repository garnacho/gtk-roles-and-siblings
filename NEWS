Overview of Changes in GTK+ 1.1.0:

* Significant speedups to widget creation and destruction through caching
  colormap and visual queries to the XServer.
* Speedups for type creation and especially gtk_type_is_a() checks.
* Speedups in signal lookup, creation and emissions and connection handling.
* Additions to the signal handling API (e.g. *_emitv).
* Minor speedups with object data allocation and destruction.
* Support for rc-file reparsing.
* Resizing logic is now implemented on container widget basis, rather than
  for toplevel GtkWindows only.
* Buttons support relief styles now.
* Some widgets are now allocated through memchunks to behave more memory wise.
* Newly included file gtkfeatures.h which defines compatibility macros to
  test for certain API features upon program compilation.
* New widget GtkCTree
* New widget GtkFontSelector.
* GtkTables are now fully resizable.
* New container widget GtkPacker.
* New object GtkItemFactory, GtkMenuFactory is deprecated.
* Far better support for widget arguments.

  is now performed by a new widget GtkAccelLabel.

* Upgrade to libtool-1.2
* Legions of bug fixes, including one that fixed a major memory leak
  in 1.0.0.
