Overview of Changes in GTK+ 0.99.4:

* Reference counting revolution integrated.
  Refer to docs/refcounting.txt on this issue.
* Implementation of a decent debugging system, you would want
  to export GTK_DEBUG=objects if you are going to develop gtk applications,
  refer to docs/debugging.txt for further information.
* Additions on the signal code for querying information about certain signals,
  and pending handlers of signals.
* Support for user signals, and major changes to internal signal handler
  handling for proper signal removal and invokation of after signals.
* Additional signals for various widgets e.g, GtkHandleBox::child_attached,
  GtkHandleBox::child_detached, GtkWidget::style_set, GtkWidget::parent_set.
* GtkTooltips became a true descendant of GtkObject via derivation from
  GtkData and facilitates an extra tip string which can be used as e.g. an
  index into context help.
* Split up of the widget/object flags into a private and a public portion,
  consult docs/widget_system.txt on this.
* Support for hot keys on gtk programs via gtk_key_snooper_install().

  simple callback functions as well.
