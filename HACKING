If you want to hack on the Gtk+ project, it will make you life easier
to have the following packages installed:

	- GNU autoconf 2.12
	- GNU automake 1.2d
		Available in ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/tromey
	- GNU libtool 1.0h
		Available in ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/

These should be available by ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the
fine GNU mirrors.  Beta software can be found at alpha.gnu.org.

If you are accessing gtk+ via CVS, then you will need to take several
steps to get it to compile.  These are:

	cvsroot/gtk+# aclocal; automake; autoconf

The "configure" script will not exist until you take these steps.

Before running configure, make sure you have libtool in your path

Please submit patches to the gtk-list@redhat.com mailing list (you must
subscribe before you post, e-mail gtk-list-request@redhat.com with a
subject of "subscribe"). All kinds of contributions are accepted. If at
all possible, please use CVS to get the latest development version of
gtk+; the README file has the CVSROOT information.
