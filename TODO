3. Fix focus activation of list items. Does list item activation have to be
   completely reorganized?

4. Lists should scroll to center the recently selected item if it isn't
   visible.


The Future
----------

-Documentation

-Tree widget

-Text widget (needs to be finished)

-Widget redrawing when the window resizes sometimes messes up.

-Make sure a widget added to a list is a list item and a widget added
 to a menu is a menu item, etc...

-More dialogs? Print, font, etc?

-Multiple document interface (MDI)?

-Support another widget style? Should be possible using GtkStyle's, but
 there may be some work needed to remove any style dependencies in widget
 code. Maybe GtkStyle's should have 'draw_push_button', 'draw_check_button',
 etc, functions to draw the various widgets.

-OffiX drag and drop support

-Make all widget attributes configurable after the widget is created.
