TODO BEFORE GTK 1.0
-------------------

Bugs:
 * gtk_list_clear_items: free start_list
 
 * Vertical scrollbar: the expose event looks hosed and is causing 
   quite a bit of flickering

 * signal parameters don't seem to get refreshed on recursive invokations
   of GTK_NO_RECURSE signals, which causes the restarted emissions to loose
   their actual point, i.e. parameter changes on the restarted emission,
   needs further investigation.

 * the GtkText widget needs to be fixed, that means no segfaults, full editing
   facilities, omit the background pixmap for now.

 * Widget redrawing when the window resizes sometimes messes up.
   GtkWindows allow_shrink is buggy since we let all kinds of configure events
   pass from Gdk to Gtk.
   GtkLabels sometimes redraw without clearing up the underlying background on
   window resizes.
 
 * delay dnd settings to take effect once a widget is realized, this is
   to avoid force realizations. i think this goes along with owens dnd
   changes?
    -timj
   The way DND data types are set in GtkWidget really needs to be fixed.
   This is pretty high on my priority list, and I'll get to it as soon as
   the column list widget is done.  The correct way dnd data needs to be set
   is to have a additional keyed data type with GtkWidget, which is applied to
   the widget's window upon realize.
   There also needs to be a way to set dnd-data on widget windows which are
   not the main window (for widgets that create more than one window).
    -Jay Painter
   DnD seems to work for me, but yes, there needs to be some sort of
   gtk_widget layer that makes it easier... Also, adding support for drop
   zones might be nice.
    -Elliot
   This one is reproducabel for me:
   testgtk --sync
   popup colorselection
   drag/drop works
   start up preview color
   drag works but not dropping
   end preview color
   drag/drop works
   start up prewiev color
   segfault in malloc
    -timj

Additions:
 * Lists should scroll to center the recently selected item if it isn't
   visible.

 * enforce invariants on *_RESIZE* and *_REDRAW* flags.

 * asure that child widgets are really get gtk_widget_destroy()ed in their
   parents destroy handler, and not just unparented or somesuch.

 * GtkToolTips:
   allocate GtkTooltipsData from memchunks
   look into incorporation of old/gtk-dairiki-971208-[01].patch.gz
                          
 * Make widget attributes configurable after the widget is created (timj).

 * Implementation of owens widget style proposal.
 
 * Are there still some GtkCList changes outstanding? (Jay Painter)
   GtkCList is derived from GtkContainer but doesn't implement the
   need_resize, focus, add and remove methods from containers.
   it should at least issue a warning upon invokation of not supported
   member functions.

 * GtkTree and GtkList should express in their *_add implementations,
   that they expect GtkListItems/GtkTreeItems as children. Similar
   things might apply to other containers.


TODO AFTER GTK 1.0
------------------

 * Make all widget attributes configurable after the widget is created (timj).
 
 * Make sure a widget added to a list is a list item and a widget added
   to a menu is a menu item, etc. GTK_BASIC was a first attempt at this,
   but it fails with subsequent container_add()s. maybe have another
   GTK_PARENT_BASIC (similar to GTK_PARENT_SENSITIVE) flag, to prevent
   tree iterations upon every container addition.

 * gdk_expose_compress: ala-Xt, this would really help for opaque moves and
   such

 * Entry should have a password mode (and it should show stars
   for user feedback).

 * More dialogs? Print, GtkFontSelector, maybe others...

 * Multiple document interface (MDI)?

 * Support another widget style? Should be possible using GtkStyle's, but
   there may be some work needed to remove any style dependencies in widget
   code. Maybe GtkStyle's should have 'draw_push_button', 'draw_check_button',
   etc, functions to draw the various widgets.
   This will be covered by upcoming themability, raster is working on it.
 
 * More work on Documentation
