      <title>Add backing store support</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  GTK+'s drawing model involves clearing to a background, and
	  then drawing widgets on top of this. Without having
	  backing-store support, this results in flickering in various
	  situations. Backing store cannot be added widget-by-widget,
	  because the drawing in a particular window is not confined
	  to a single widget. Instead it needs to be added per GDK
	  window. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The way this is done is by having
	  <tt>gdk_window_begin_paint()</tt>
	  and <tt>gdk_window_end_paint()</tt> functions that
	  redirect all drawing to a particular window to an offscreen
	  pixmap, and then copy that offscreen pixmap back onto the
	  screen when the paint operation is done. The implementation
	  of this is mostly complete in the <tt>gtk-no-flicker</tt> branch of
	  GTK+.

      <title>32 Bit Coordinates</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  GTK+-1.2 and earlier share X's limitation on the
	  size of coordinates and restrict all dimensions
	  to 16 bit quantities. By clever use of X it is
	  possible to lift this restriction and present a
	  full 32-bit space to the user.

      <title>Switch to using UTF-8</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  This is closely related to Pango integration. Pango deals
	  with all strings in terms of UTF-8; by switching GTK+ over
	  to UTF-8 we make it considerably simpler for developers to
	  support multiple languages properly while still retaining
	  a large degree of compatibility with existing programs.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Some work has already been done on this as part of the Win32
	  port, since the Win32 port is currently using UTF-8 for all
	  strings. In general, this should be an easy job; the hardest
	  parts are places like GtkFileSelection, cut and paste, and
	  input method support where there is interaction between GTK+
	  and the operating system.

      <title>Rewrite Input Method Support</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  Current support for Input Methods is done via XIM, with
	  supported styles being over-the-spot and the root-window
	  styles. However, the over-the-spot style is not going to
	  work well with the Pango integration, since it relies on the
	  text rendering in the program being done in the standard
	  Xlib style, so it will be necessary to also support
	  on-the-spot input. On-the-spot input is done by supplying a
	  set of callbacks that are invoked by the input methods.

	  While adding the above support, it may be desirable to

      <description>
	<p>
	  Many types of object arguments (expander style in the CList,

      <description>
	<p>
	  There are a number of global parameters in GTK+ and GDK that should be
	  customizable by the user, such as the double-click timeout,
	  or whether widgets should be backing-stored by default. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  If we had argument customization from an RC file, it might
	  be possible to do this simply with a global object with

	  The title of a frame should simply be another child widget
	  which, by default, holds a label widget. This will important
	  with Pango where proper text behavior will be more complex to

	  designs. (It can be useful, for example, to put a checkbutton

      <title>Replace GtkText Widget</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  The GtkText widget is badly in need of replacement, since it is
	  buggy and insufficiently feature rich. There are a number
	  of possible candidates for a replacement, with the most
	  promising at the current time being Havoc Pennington's
	  (hp@redhat.com) port of the Tk Text widget.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As part of this job it will be necessary to add
	  <a href="http://www.pango.org">Pango</a> support to the
	  replacement. The structure of the Tk text widget port seems
	  suited to this as it works paragraph-by-paragraph, and
	  Pango works at a sub-paragraph scale.

      <title>Add unified set of List/Tree/Grid widgets</title>
      <description>
	<p>
	  Currently, GTK+ has a large number of list and tree widgets
	  (GtkList, GtkTree, GtkCList, GtkCTree), none of which are
	  ideal. The GtkList and GtkTree widgets perform badly on large
	  number of items. (GtkTree widget is also quite buggy.) GtkCList
	  and GtkCTree mostly solve the size problem, but are quite
	  complex and, despite that, not very flexible. They are limited to
	  displaying pixmaps and text, and can neither support arbitrary
	  widgets nor custom drawing functions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In addition to list and tree widgets, a closely related need
	  is a sheet widget that displays a (possibly editable) 2-D grid.
	  It would be desirable to have a complete set of widgets that
	  could be presented as the one-true-solution for these needs.
	  Model/View techniques could be used effectively to increase
	  both the simplicity and power of the interfaces.
