Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the GLIB library, available at the same location as
you got this package.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gtk+-1.1.8.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-1.1.8                          # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                            # run the `configure' script
  % make                                   # build GTK
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                           # install GTK

The Nitty-Gritty
================

The 'configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. For a complete list, type:

  ./configure --help

A few of the more important ones:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                           [ Defaults to /usr/local ]

*  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                           [ Defaults to the value given to --prefix ]

*  --with-xinput=[no/gxi/xfree] support XInput [default=no]

The --with-xinput flag specifies whether to compile with support
for the XInput extension (mainly used for graphics tablets), and
which form of support to use:

  no    : no support 
  gxi   : Use generic XInput support
  xfree : Use special features in the Wacom drivers in XFree86 3.3.1
          and later.

For more information, follow the link from http://www.gtk.org

*  --enable-xim            support XIM [default=yes]

Specifying --disable-xim will disable support for entering
internationalized text using X Input Methods. This will give some
slight savings in speed and memory use and might be necessary
with older versions of X.

*  --with-locale=LOCALE   locale name you want to use

The --with-locale options is used to determine if your operating
system has support for the locale you will be using. If not, X's
built in locale support will be used.

Because of bugs in autoconf, it is necessary to specify this
option even if your LANG environment variable is correctly set.

This option does not determine which locale GTK will use at
runtime. That will be determined from the usual environment
variables.  If you will be using multiple locales with GTK,
specify the one for which your operating system has the worst
support for the --with-locale option.


Options can be given to the compiler and linker by setting
environment variables before running configure. A few of the more
important ones:

 CC       : The C compiler to use
 CPPFLAGS : Flags for the C preprocesser such as -I and -D
 CFLAGS   : C compiler flags

The most important use of this is to set the
optimization/debugging flags. For instance, to compile with no
debugging information at all, run configure as:

 CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure           # Bourne compatible shells (sh/bash/zsh)

or,

 setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure  # csh and variants


Using an uninstalled copy of GLIB
=================================

You can compile GTK+ against a copy of GLIB that you have not
yet installed. To do this, give the --with-glib=DIR options
to ./configure. For instance:

 ./configure --with-glib=../glib-1.1.8

This, however, will not work if you built GLIB with different
source and build directories.


Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. There are also more
detailed flags to control individual directories. However, the
use of these flags is not tested.

One particular detail to note, is that the architecture-dependent
include file glibconfig.h is installed in:

  $exec_pref/lib/glib/include/

if you have a version in $prefix/include, this is out of date
and should be deleted.

A shell script gtk-config is created during the configure
process, and installed in the bin/ directory
($exec_prefix/bin). This is used to determine the location of GTK
when building applications.  If you move GTK after installation,
it will be necessary to edit this file.

For complete details, see the file docs/gtk-config.txt


Notes for using XIM support for Japanese input
==============================================

* There is a bug in older versions of kinput2 that will cause GTK
to hang when destroying a text entry. The latest versions of
kinput is available from:

  ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/x11/kinput2

* The locale information file for the ja_JP EUC locale
distributed with some recent versions of X11 specifies to use the
C library multibyte functions. Unless your C library has support
for Japanese locales, this is incorrect, and will cause problems
for GTK's internationalization.

(In particular, this occurs with GNU libc 2.0 and 2.1, in which
the multibyte functions always translate to and from UTF-8; but
the problem may occur for other C libraries, and other operating
systems as well.)

To fix this, change the line:

use_stdc_env		True

to 

use_stdc_env		False

in the file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/ja_JP/XLC_LOCALE.
