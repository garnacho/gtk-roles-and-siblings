Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, and Atk libraries, available at the same location as GTK+
   (Either Pango-1.0 or Pango-1.2 can be used with GTK+-2.2; 
   Pango-1.2 is recommended.)

 - The TIFF, PNG, and JPEG image loading libraries. You most
   likely have these installed on your system already. If not
   these libraries are available from:

    http://www.libtiff.org/
    ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/src/
    ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/

   If these libraries are not available, the corresponding 
   image loaders will simply not be built. However, this
   may cause applications using GTK+ not to function properly.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gtk+-2.2.0.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-2.2.0			   # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure				   # run the `configure' script
  % make				   # build GTK
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install			   # install GTK
