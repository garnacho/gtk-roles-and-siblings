This document is a laundry list of stuff to check if you want to
verify that GtkTreeView and associated objects are working properly.

TreeModel testing:

 - all the TreeView/TreeModel tests in this document should be run 
   with each of the different models testtreeview supports

 - ensure that swapping in a new model for the tree view when there
   was a preexisting one exists already
