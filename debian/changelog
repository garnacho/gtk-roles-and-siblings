gtk+ (1:0.99.7-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

gtk+ (1:0.99.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream source added a /usr/lib/glib/ directory that I didn't
    notice; included this directory in libgtk-dev.
  * Realized that Xinput support was broken because I was doing
    ./configure --enable-xinput=xfree instead of ./configure
    --with-xinput=xfree. Fixed.

gtk+ (1:0.99.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release -- THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH OLDER RELEASES!
    All Gtk-using packages *will* need patches to work with this Gtk!
  * Upstream release includes 'gtk-config' script to check installed
    version of Gtk; included said script in libgtk-dev in /usr/bin.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Mar 1998 11:03:03 -0800

gtk+ (1:0.99.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified libgtk-doc to Replace: libgtk-dev (<< 1:0.99.4) to
    deal with both packages including the same .info files.
    Fixes bug #19533.
  * Also noticed that libgtk-dev depended on libgtk1 without
    an epoch! Fixed.

gtk+ (1:0.99.4-2) unstable; urgency=MEDIUM

  * Ack! The shlibs file makes things depend on libgtk1 (>= 0.99.4)
    rather than (>= 1:0.99.4)! Fixes bug #19134.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Mar 1998 23:57:33 -0800

gtk+ (1:0.99.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Recompiled with new debhelper to remove du warnings.
  * Upstream source is named gtk+, not libgtk1. Changed source name.
  * Removed --disable-xim in hopes that xim is no longer broken.
  * Removed testgtk at the behest of the Gtk developers until I can
    come up with a better solution, probably related to:
  * the new libgtk-doc package! :) libgtk-doc contains the Gtk FAQ,
    the Gtk Tutorial, and the Gtk info files.
