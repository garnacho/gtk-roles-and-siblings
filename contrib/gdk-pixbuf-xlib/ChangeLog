	* gdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0.pc.in (Description): fix up description a bit.

2000-10-06  Havoc Pennington  <hp@redhat.com>

	* gdk-pixbuf-xlib.c: Put display/screen here, instead of in 
	the main gdk-pixbuf library as it was in 1.0; since the io-xpm 
	loader doesn't use these variables anymore it should be OK

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib-drawable.c
	(gdk_pixbuf_xlib_get_from_drawable): Do not use
	gdk_screen_{width,height}().  Thanks to John Harper for pointing
	this out.

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlibrgb.c: Added API reference docs.

2000-08-25  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@helixcode.com>

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib-drawable.c (handle_x_error): Return
	0.
	(xlib_window_is_viewable): Return FALSE in the last case.

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib-render.c: Updated the inline docs.

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib.c: Added API docs.

	Work to create an Xlib version of gdk-pixbuf (with the Xlib
	port of GdkRGB for rendering):

	* configure.in: check for X libraries, set and substitute
	GDK_PIXBUF_XLIB_{LIBDIR,INCLUDEDIR,LIBS} variables

	* gdk_pixbuf_xlibConf.sh.in: new file -- gnome-config details
	for the gdk-pixbuf-xlib library
	* Makefile.am: build and install gdk_pixbuf_xlibConf.sh

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib-render.c,
	gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib.c, gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib.h,
	gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib-private.h,
	gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlib-drawable.c: new files, ported the
	GDK dependent parts of gdk-pixbuf to use Xlib. Functions that
	were called gdk_pixbuf_FOO are now gdk_pixbuf_xlib_FOO

	* gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlibrgb.c,
	gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf-xlibrgb.h: added Chris Blizzard's Xlib
	port of GdkRGB (from Mozilla CVS)

	* gdk-pixbuf/Makefile.am: build a library libgdk_pixbuf_xlib.la
	including the non-GDK dependent objects from libgdk_pixbuf.la
	plus the Xlib ports and xlibrgb
