The GDK DirectFB backend was written by

 Denis Oliver Kropp <dok@directfb.org>
 Sven Neumann <neo@directfb.org>

Large parts of the code are based on other GDK backends
especially the linuxfb backend which was written mainly
by Alex Larsson <alexl@redhat.com>.


The upgrade to gtk 2.8.x was done by 

 Michael Emmel <mike.emmel@gmail.com>


Extensive help and support and code was recieved from the Debian
community especially the Debian installer team who bravely chose to
use the gdk directfb port for the graphical debian installer. In
particular

 Attilio Fiandrotti <fiandro@tiscalinet.it>
 Davide Viti <zinosat@tiscali.it>

for there tireless work bringing the backend from a small project to
stability.

And finally thanks to the Extremadura goverment for bringing the
directfb developers and debian installer team together for a workshop.
