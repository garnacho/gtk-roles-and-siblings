All the .po files are now in UTF-8!

For information on editing UTF-8 files on Unix, see
<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html>

If you just want to convert it back to your native encoding to
edit and then convert again to UTF-8 to commit, please see the
scripts in gnome-i18n/UTF-8, for example

  export ENCODING_TO=ISO-8895-15
  utftopo fi.po
  emacs fi.po
  potoutf.sh fi.po
  cvs commit fi.po

If you need help with this, ask, but please don't commit
non-UTF-8 files here.
