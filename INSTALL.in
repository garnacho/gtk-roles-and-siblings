Prerequisites
=============

GTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, and Atk libraries, available at the same location as GTK+
   (Either Pango-1.0 or Pango-1.2 can be used with GTK+-2.2; 
   Pango-1.2 is recommended.)

 - The TIFF, PNG, and JPEG image loading libraries. You most
   likely have these installed on your system already. If not
   these libraries are available from:

    http://www.libtiff.org/
    http://www.libpng.org/
    http://www.ijg.org/

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd gtk+-@GTK_VERSION@.tar.gz | tar xvf - # unpack the sources
  % cd gtk+-@GTK_VERSION@			   # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure				   # run the `configure' script
  % make				   # build GTK
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install			   # install GTK
