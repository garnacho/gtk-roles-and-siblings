<para>
The #GdkFont data type represents a font for drawing on
the screen. These functions provide support for
loading fonts, and also for determining the dimensions
of characters and strings when drawn with a particular
font.
</para>

<para>
Fonts in X are specified by a
<firstterm>X Logical Font Description</firstterm>. 
The following description is considerably simplified.
For definitive information about XLFD's see the 
X reference documentation. A X Logical Font Description (XLFD)
consists of a sequence of fields separated (and surrounded by) '-'
characters. For example, Adobe Helvetica Bold 12 pt, has the
full description: 

<programlisting>
"-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-70-iso8859-1"
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The fields in the XLFD are:

</para>

<para>
When specifying a font via a X logical Font Description,
'*' can be used as a wildcard to match any portion of
the XLFD. For instance, the above example could
also be specified as

<programlisting>
"-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1"
</programlisting>

It is generally a good idea to use wildcards for any
portion of the XLFD that your program does not care
about specifically, since that will improve the
chances of finding a matching font.
</para>

<para>
A <firstterm>fontset</firstterm> is a list of fonts
that is used for drawing international text that may
contain characters from a number of different character
sets. It is represented by a list of XLFD's. 
</para>

<para>
The font for a given character set is determined by going
through the list of XLFD's in order. For each one, if
the registry and and encoding fields match the desired
character set, then that font is used, otherwise if
the XLFD contains wild-cards for the registry and encoding
fields, the registry and encoding for the desired character
set are substituted in and a lookup is done. If a match is found
that font is used. Otherwise, processing continues
on to the next font in the list.
</para>

<para>
The functions for determining the metrics of a string
come in several varieties that can take a number
of forms of string input:

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>8-bit string</term>
    <listitem><para>
    When using functions like gdk_string_width() that
    take a <type>gchar *</type>, if the font is of type
    %GDK_FONT_FONT and is an 8-bit font, then each
    <type>gchar</type> indexes the glyphs in the font directly.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>16-bit string</term>
    <listitem><para>
    For functions taking a <type>gchar *</type>, if the
    font is of type %GDK_FONT_FONT, and is a 16-bit
    font, then the <type>gchar *</type> argument is
    interpreted as a <type>guint16 *</type> cast to
    a <type>gchar *</type> and each <type>guint16</type>
    indexes the glyphs in the font directly.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>Multibyte string</term>
    <listitem><para>
    For functions taking a <type>gchar *</type>, if the
    font is of type %GDK_FONT_FONTSET, then the input
    string is interpreted as a <firstterm>multibyte</firstterm>
    encoded according to the current locale. (A multibyte
    string is one in which each character may consist
    of one or more bytes, with different lengths for different
    characters in the string). They can be converted to and
    from wide character strings (see below) using
    gdk_wcstombs() and gdk_mbstowcs().) The string will
    be rendered using one or more different fonts from
    the fontset.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>Wide character string</term>
    <listitem><para>
    For a number of the text-measuring functions, GDK
    provides a variant (such as gdk_text_width_wc()) which
    takes a <type>GdkWChar *</type> instead of a 
    <type>gchar *</type>. The input is then taken to
    be a wide character string in the encoding of the
    current locale. (A wide character string is a string
    in which each character consists of several bytes,
    and the width of each character in the string is 
    constant.)
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para>

<para>
GDK provides functions to determine a number of different
measurements (metrics) for a given string. (Need diagram
here).

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>ascent</term>
    <listitem><para>
    The vertical distance from the origin of the drawing
    opereration to the top of the drawn character.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>descent</term>
    <listitem><para>
    The vertical distance from the origin of the drawing
    opereration to the bottom of the drawn character.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>left bearing</term>
    <listitem><para>
    The horizontal distance from the origin of the drawing
    operation to the left-most part of the drawn character.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>right bearing</term>
    <listitem><para>
    The horizontal distance from the origin of the drawing
    operation to the right-most part of the drawn character.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term>width bearing</term>
    <listitem><para>
    The horizontal distance from the origin of the drawing
    operation to the correct origin for drawing another
    string to follow the current one. Depending on the
    font, this could be greater than or less than the 
    right bearing.
    </para></listitem>

<!-- ##### TYPEDEF GdkWChar ##### -->
<para>
Specifies a wide character type, used to represent character codes.
This is needed since some native languages have character sets which have
more than 256 characters (Japanese and Chinese, for example).
</para>
<para>
Wide character values between 0 and 127 are always identical in meaning to
the ASCII character codes. The wide character value 0 is often used to
terminate strings of wide characters in a similar way to normal strings
using the char type.
</para>
<para>
An alternative to wide characters is multi-byte characters, which extend
normal char strings to cope with larger character sets. As the name suggests,
multi-byte characters use a different number of bytes to store different
character codes. For example codes 0-127 (i.e. the ASCII codes) often
use just one byte of memory, while other codes may use 2, 3 or even 4 bytes.
Multi-byte characters have the advantage that they can often be used in an
application with little change, since strings are still represented as arrays
of char values. However multi-byte strings are much easier to manipulate since
the character are all of the same size.
</para>
<para>
Applications typically use wide characters to represent character codes
internally, and multi-byte strings when saving the characters to a file.
The gdk_wcstombs() and gdk_mbstowcs() functions can be used to convert from
one representation to the other.
</para>
<para>
See the 'Extended Characters' section of the GNU C Library Reference Manual
for more detailed information on wide and multi-byte characters.
</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gdk_wcstombs ##### -->
<para>
Converts a wide character string to a multi-byte string.
(The function name comes from an acronym of 'Wide Character String TO
Multi-Byte String').
</para>

@src: a wide character string.
@Returns: the multi-byte string corresponding to @src, or %NULL if the
conversion failed. The returned string should be freed with g_free() when no
longer needed.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gdk_mbstowcs ##### -->
<para>
Converts a multi-byte string to a wide character string.
(The function name comes from an acronym of 'Multi-Byte String TO Wide
Character String').
</para>

@dest: the space to place the converted wide character string into.
@src: the multi-byte string to convert, which must be nul-terminated.
@dest_max: the maximum number of wide characters to place in @dest.
@Returns: the number of wide characters written into @dest, or -1 if the
conversion failed.
