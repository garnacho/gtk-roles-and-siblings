Animations as multi-frame structures.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
  <para>
    The GdkPixbuf library provides a simple mechanism to load and
    represent animations, primarily animated GIF files.  Animations
    are represented as lists of #GdkPixbufFrame structures.  Each
    frame structure contains a #GdkPixbuf structure and information
    about the frame's overlay mode and duration.
  </para>

<!-- ##### ENUM GdkPixbufFrameAction ##### -->
  <para>
    Each animation frame can have several things happen to it when the
    next frame is displayed.  The #GdkPixbufFrameAction determines this.
    If a frame as marked as #GDK_PIXBUF_FRAME_RETAIN, then the image
    will remain displayed, and will be potentially occluded by the next
    frame.  If it is marked as #GDK_PIXBUF_FRAME_DISPOSE, then the
    animation is reverted to the setting before the frame was shown.  If
    it is marked as #GDK_PIXBUF_FRAME_REVERT, then the animation is
    reverted to the first image before continuing.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GdkPixbufFrame ##### -->
  <para>
    This structure describes a frame in a #GdkPixbufAnimation.  Each
    frame consists of a #GdkPixbuf, an offset of the frame within the
    animation's bounding box, a duration, and an overlay mode or
    action.
  </para>

@pixbuf: The frame's image contents.
@x_offset: X offset of the frame inside the animation's bounding box.
@y_offset: Y offset of the frame inside the animation's bounding box.
@delay_time: Duration of the frame in milliseconds.
@action: Overlay mode.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GdkPixbufAnimation ##### -->
  <para>
    This structure describes an animation, which is represented as a
    list of #GdkPixbufFrame structures.
  </para>

@ref_count: Reference count.
@n_frames: Number of frames in the animation.
@frames: List of #GdkPixbufFrame structures.
