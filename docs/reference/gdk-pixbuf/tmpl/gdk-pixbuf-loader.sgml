Application-driven image loading.

  <para>
    #GdkPixbufLoader provides a way for applications to drive the
    process of loading an image.  Applications can use this
    functionality instead of gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() when they need
    to parse image data in small chunks, such as when reading it from
    a network connection.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GdkPixbufLoader::area-updated ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when a significant area of the image being
    loaded has been updated.  Normally it means that a complete
    scanline has been read in, but it could be a different area as
    well.  Applications can use this signal to know when to repaint
    areas of an image that is being loaded.
  </para>

@gdkpixbufloader: the object which received the signal.
@arg1: 
@arg2: 
@arg3: 
@arg4: 
<!-- # Unused Parameters # -->
@loader: Loader which emitted the signal.
@x: X offset of upper-left corner of the updated area.
@y: Y offset of upper-left corner of the updated area.
@width: Width of updated area.
@height: Height of updated area.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GdkPixbufLoader::area-prepared ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when the pixbuf loader has been fed the
    initial amount of data that is required to figure out the size and
    format of the image that it will create.  After this signal is
    emitted, applications can call gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf() to
    fetch the partially-loaded pixbuf.
  </para>

@gdkpixbufloader: the object which received the signal.
<!-- # Unused Parameters # -->
@loader: Loader which emitted the signal.

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GdkPixbufLoader::closed ##### -->
  <para>
    This signal is emitted when gdk_pixbuf_loader_close() is called.
    It can be used by different parts of an application to receive
    notification when an image loader is closed by the code that
    drives it.
  </para>

@gdkpixbufloader: the object which received the signal.
<!-- # Unused Parameters # -->
@loader: Loader which emitted the signal.
