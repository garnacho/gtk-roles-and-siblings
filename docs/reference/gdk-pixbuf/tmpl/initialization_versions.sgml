This is the version currently in use by a running program.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gdk_pixbuf_major_version ##### -->

&gdk-pixbuf; version 1.2.5 this is 1.) 
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
&gdk-pixbuf; library you have linked against. Contrast with the

&gdk-pixbuf; headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gdk_pixbuf_minor_version ##### -->
<para>
The minor version number of the &gdk-pixbuf; library.  (e.g. in 
&gdk-pixbuf; version 1.2.5 this is 2.) 
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
&gdk-pixbuf; library you have linked against. Contrast with the
#GDK_PIXBUF_MINOR macro, which represents the minor version of the
&gdk-pixbuf; headers you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE gdk_pixbuf_micro_version ##### -->
<para>
The micro version number of the &gdk-pixbuf; library.  (e.g. in 
&gdk-pixbuf; version 1.2.5 this is 5.) 
</para>

<para>
This variable is in the library, so represents the
&gdk-pixbuf; library you have linked against. Contrast with the
