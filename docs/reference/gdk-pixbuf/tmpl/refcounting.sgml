Reference Counting and Memory Mangement

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->

Functions for reference counting and memory management on pixbufs.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
  <para>
    #GdkPixbuf structures are reference counted.  This means that an
    application can share a single pixbuf among many parts of the
    code.  When a piece of the program needs to keep a pointer to a
    pixbuf, it should add a reference to it by calling g_object_ref().
    When it no longer needs the pixbuf, it should subtract a reference
    by calling g_object_unref().  The pixbuf will be destroyed when
    its reference count drops to zero.  Newly-created #GdkPixbuf
    structures start with a reference count of one.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      As #GdkPixbuf is derived from #GObject now, gdk_pixbuf_ref() and
      gdk_pixbuf_unref() are deprecated in favour of g_object_ref()
      and g_object_unref () resp.

  <para>
    <emphasis>Finalizing</emphasis> a pixbuf means to free its pixel
    data and to free the #GdkPixbuf structure itself.  Most of the
    library functions that create #GdkPixbuf structures create the
    pixel data by themselves and define the way it should be freed;
    you do not need to worry about those.  The only function that lets
    you specify how to free the pixel data is
    gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data().  Since you pass it a pre-allocated
    pixel buffer, you must also specify a way to free that data.  This
    is done with a function of type #GdkPixbufDestroyNotify.  When a
    pixbuf created with gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data() is finalized, your
    destroy notification function will be called, and it is its
    responsibility to free the pixel array.

  <para>
    A function of this type is responsible for freeing the pixel array
    of a pixbuf.  The gdk_pixbuf_new_from_data() function lets you
    pass in a pre-allocated pixel array so that a pixbuf can be
    created from it; in this case you will need to pass in a function
    of #GdkPixbufDestroyNotify so that the pixel data can be freed
    when the pixbuf is finalized.
  </para>

@pixels: The pixel array of the pixbuf that is being finalized.
@data: User closure data.
