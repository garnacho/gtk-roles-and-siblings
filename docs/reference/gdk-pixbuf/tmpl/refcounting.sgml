Reference Counting

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Functions to perform reference counting on a #GdkPixbuf.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
  <para>
    #GdkPixbuf structures are reference counted.  This means that
    an application can share a single pixbuf among many parts of the
    code.  When a piece of the program needs to keep a pointer to a
    pixbuf, it should add a reference to it.  When it no longer needs
    the pixbuf, it should subtract a reference.  The pixbuf will be
    destroyed when its reference count drops to zero.  Newly-created
    #GdkPixbuf structures start with a reference count of one.
