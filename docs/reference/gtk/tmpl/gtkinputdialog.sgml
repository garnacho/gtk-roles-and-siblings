<para>
 NOTE this widget is considered too specialized/little-used for
 GTK+, and will in the future be moved to some other package.  If
 your application needs this widget, feel free to use it, as the
 widget does work and is useful in some applications; it's just not
 of general interest. However, we are not accepting new features for
 the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+
 distribution.

<para>
#GtkInputDialog displays a dialog which allows the user
to configure XInput extension devices. For each
device, they can control the mode of the device
(disabled, screen-relative, or window-relative), 
the mapping of axes to coordinates, and the
mapping of the devices macro keys to key press
events.
</para>
<para>
#GtkInputDialog contains two buttons to which
the application can connect; one for closing
the dialog, and one for saving the changes.
No actions are bound to these by default.
The changes that the user makes take effect
immediately.
