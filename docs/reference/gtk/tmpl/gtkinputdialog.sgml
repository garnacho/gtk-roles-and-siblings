<para>
#GtkInputDialog displays a dialog which allows the user
to configure XInput extension devices. For each
device, they can control the mode of the device
(disabled, screen-relative, or window-relative), 
the mapping of axes to coordinates, and the
mapping of the devices macro keys to key press
events.

<para>
#GtkInputDialog contains two buttons to which
the application can connect; one for closing
the dialog, and one for saving the changes.
No actions are bound to these by default.
The changes that the user makes take effect
immediately.
