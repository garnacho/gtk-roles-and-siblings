The base class of the Gtk type hierarchy.

<title>Description</title>
<para>
GtkObject is the root of the gtk+ type hierarchy.  It serves
a similar roles as java's Object class.  It is used 
by the type-casting system to represent the base composite type.
</para>
<para>
Objects have <wordasword>arguments</wordasword> that are
name/typed-value pairs.  
They may be readable or writable (or both or neither).
The special handlers in every object are responsible for
setting and getting these parameters.
If the handler for a given argument <emphasis>must</emphasis>
be called before the object may be used, be sure the
#GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT or #GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT_ONLY flags
are set;  otherwise they are set only when the user does so.
</para>
<para>
Object also store a simpler association table, sometimes
called the object_data.  This is just an efficient mapping from
a fixed set of strings to a gpointer.  This can be used as
arbitrary extra members.  Notice that each new field name
allocates a new quark, so it is probably best only to use
this for fields with fixed names.
</para>
<para>
The primary difference between object_data and arguments is that
the object defines two functions which set and get each type of argument.
The object just has a table to store its object data in:  it does not
receive notice when data changes.
</para>
<para>
Objects are reference counted;  this means that we maintain
a count of how many references (usually in the form of a pointer)
are being held to this object.
To indicate that you reference an object, call gtk_object_ref().
The object will not be freed until everyone calls 
gtk_object_unref().
</para>
<para>
In order to reduce the chances of a memory leak, gtk+ defines
"floating objects".  All objects created with gtk_object_new()
start out floating with a reference count of 1.
In order to reduce that initial reference count you should gtk_object_sink()
them, but usually the parent widget you add the child to will
sink the object.  
</para>
<para>So, because gtk_widget_set_parent() sinks the object from
gtk_container_add(), there are no memory leaks in this code:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
	button = gtk_button_new_with_label("Hi Mom!");
	gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(window), button);
	/* Button may not be used anymore since we don't retain a reference
	 * to it. */
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
Likewise, the following code attaches the same adjustment to two
ranges:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
	adjustment = (GtkAdjustment*) gtk_adjustment_new(0,10,0,0,0,0);
	gtk_range_set_adjustment(range1, adjustment);
	gtk_range_set_adjustment(range2, adjustment);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
Note that we could put as many set_adjustments as we like:  cleanup is easy
because they all retain a reference but only one sinks the initial reference
count.  If it is possible for "range1" to stop retaining its reference
then we need to enclose the lines using "adjustment" with ref/unref
to guarantee the the object won't be deleted:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
	adjustment = (GtkAdjustment*) gtk_adjustment_new(0,10,0,0,0,0);
	gtk_object_ref(GTK_OBJECT(adjustment));
	gtk_range_set_adjustment(range1, adjustment);
	gtk_range_set_adjustment(range1, another_adjustment);
	/* With the initial reference, `adjustment' would have
	 * been deleted as `range1' lost its reference to it. */
	gtk_range_set_adjustment(range2, adjustment);
	gtk_object_unref(GTK_OBJECT(adjustment));
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>
<para>
Be careful with reference counting:  if two objects reference eachother
then they will always have at least reference count 1, even if
there are no other pointers to them.  This means that they
will never be freed.  More precisely, you must be certain that
your references <emphasis>never</emphasis> can form cycles.
</para>
<para>
If you find yourself forming cyclic references, perhaps you
can convert some of them to <wordasword>weak-references</wordasword>.
A weak-reference is one that holds a pointer to an object,
but doesn't increase the reference count.  To insure
the object is valid when the referer tries to use it,
the referer registers a callback that will be invoked
after the object has been destroyed (but before its memory is actually
deallocated).  This callback must prevent the weak-reference from
being used again.

@klass: a pointer to the GtkObjectClass (or deriver) which contains 
the methods defined by this object.
@flags: the state of the object: whether it has been constructed
or destroyed, for example.
@ref_count: a reference count.  It is incremented when new
pointers to this object are made, and decremented when the
pointers are deleted.  When the reference count
returns to 0, the object is deleted.  By default, objects
have reference count 0 when created.
@object_data: 

<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_TYPE ##### -->
<para>
Get the type of an object.
</para>

Tells about the state of the object.
</para>

@GTK_DESTROYED: the GtkObject has had gtk_object_destroyed() invoked on it
and is processing the shutdown callback.

object.
@GTK_CONSTRUCTED: refers to whether the arguments for this object are
ready.

</para>

@obj: the object to examine.


<!-- ##### MACRO GTK_OBJECT_FLOATING ##### -->
<para>
When an object is created, it has an initial reference count
of 1 and is floating.  <wordasword>Sinking</wordasword> the object 
refers to decrementing that original reference count.
</para>

@obj: the object to examine.

</para>

@GTK_ARG_READABLE: the argument is readable. (i.e. can be queried)
@GTK_ARG_WRITABLE: the argument is writable. (i.e. settable)
@GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT: the argument needs construction.
@GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT_ONLY: the argument needs construction (and will
be set once during object creation), but is otherwise cannot be
set.  Hence this flag is not allowed with #GTK_ARG_WRITABLE,
and is redundant with #GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT.
@GTK_ARG_CHILD_ARG: an argument type that applies to (and may be different for)
each child.  Used by #GtkContainer.
@GTK_ARG_MASK: the bitwise-OR of all the flags.
@GTK_ARG_READWRITE: the argument is readable and writable.

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_class_user_signal_new ##### -->
<para>

object.
</para>
<para>
See the signal documentation for more general information.
</para>

@klass: the object class to define the signal for.
@name: the name of the signal.
@signal_flags: the default emission behavior for the signal.
See gtk_signal_new().
@marshaller: a function that will take an array of GtkArgs
and invoke the appropriate handler with the normal calling
conventions.
@return_val: specify the return-value type for the signal
(or GTK_TYPE_NONE for no return-value).
@nparams: specify the number of parameters the signal
receives from the caller of gtk_signal_emit().
@Varargs: list of nparams #GtkTypes to pass to the signal handlers.
@Returns: the signal id.  (See #GtkSignals)


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_class_user_signal_newv ##### -->
<para>
Define a signal-handler for a new signal on an already defined
object.
</para>

@klass: the object class to define the signal for.
@name: the name of the signal.
@signal_flags: the default emission behavior for the signal.
See gtk_signal_new().
@marshaller: takes a GtkObject, a #GtkSignalFunc, and an array
of arguments, and invokes the function using the appropriate
calling conventions.  Usually just select a function
out of gtkmarshal.h.
@return_val: specify the return-value type for the signal (possibly
#GTK_TYPE_NONE).
@nparams: specify the number of parameters the signal
receives from the caller of gtk_signal_emit().
@params: array of #GtkTypes the signal handlers for this signal
should have in their prototype (of length nparams).
@Returns: the signal id.  (See #GtkSignals)


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_new ##### -->
<para>
Construct an object given its arguments, enumerated in the call to the
function.
</para>

@type: the type identifying this object.  Returned by gtk_type_unique()
although (for a properly-written object it should be accessible through
#GTK_TYPE_FOO.)
@first_arg_name: name of the first argument to set when constructing
the object.
@Varargs: the first argument's value, followed by any number of
name/argument-value pairs, terminated with NULL.
@Returns: the new GtkObject.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_newv ##### -->
<para>
Construct an object with an array of arguments.
</para>

@object_type: the type of the object to create.
@n_args: the number of arguments to set.
@args: an array of n_args arguments (which are name and value pairs).
@Returns: the new GtkObject.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_constructed ##### -->
<para>
Mark an allocated object as constructed.
This is used for situations
that require precise control of the construction process.
</para>
<para>
This is done when gtk_object_default_construct() is inadequate.
In #GtkCList the need arises because #GtkCList does construction work that
must happen <emphasis>after</emphasis> its derivers.  This work
cannot be done in an initializer function, so an alternate
constructor is mandatory.  It calls gtk_object_constructed() to
indicate it has done its job, so that no other constructor will
be invoked.
</para>
<para>
Normally this function is just automatically run from
gtk_object_default_construct().
</para>

@object: object which has been constructed.  This is usually
done automatically by gtk_object_new() and gtk_object_newv().


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_default_construct ##### -->
<para>
This function is called to construct arguments that haven't been initialized
but have the #GTK_ARG_CONSTRUCT flag set.
</para>
<para>
All number arguments are set to 0.  All pointers and strings
are set to NULL.
</para>
<para>
Normally invoked by gtk_object_new() automatically; gtk_type_new() can
be used to bypass it.
</para>

@object: the object to initialize.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_sink ##### -->
<para>
Decrement the initial count given to the object.
Additional invocations have no effect.
</para>
<para>
This is designed to free the user from worrying about
dereferencing an object that they have just created.
So long as the object is sunk at some point, the reference count
will be set properly.
</para>
<para>
furthermore it may be sunk multiple times.
Only the first time will actually dereference.
</para>
<para>
The basic outline is: when you create an object it is floating.
Setting its parent causes it to be sunk, however its parent
has obtained a reference, so its reference count is one.
</para>

@object: the object to sink.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_ref ##### -->
<para>
Increase the reference count of the object.
</para>

@object: the object to reference.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_unref ##### -->
<para>
Decrease the reference count of an object.  When its reference
count drops to 0, the object is deleted.
</para>
<para>
If it was not already destroyed, it will be, with gtk_object_destroy(),
then weak links are notified, then the object-data is freed
and the memory for the object itself is freed using gtk_type_free().
</para>

@object: the object to dereference.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_weakref ##### -->
<para>
Adds a weak reference callback to an object.
</para>
<para>
Weak references are a mechanism to safely keep a pointer to
an object without using the reference counting
mechansim.  They use a callback function to receive
notice that the object is about to be freed (aka finalized).
This happens <emphasis>after</emphasis> the destroy
callback has been run.
</para>

@object: object to weakly reference.
@notify: callback to invoke before the object is freed.
@data: extra data to pass to #notify.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_weakunref ##### -->
<para>
Removes a weak reference callback to an object.
</para>

@object: object stop weakly referencing.
@notify: callback to search for.
@data: data to search for.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_destroy ##### -->
<para>
Calls the object's shutdown handler.
</para>
<para>
The memory for the object itself won't be deleted until
its reference count drops to 0, though.
See gtk_object_unref().
</para>

@object: the object to destroy.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_getv ##### -->
<para>
Gets an array of argument values from an object.
</para>

@object: the object to get arguments from.
@n_args: the number of arguments to query.
@args: the arguments to fill in.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set ##### -->
<para>
This function sets multiple arguments of an object.
</para>
<para>
It takes an object, then a list of name/value pairs
in a list, followed by NULL.
</para>
<para>
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
void set_box_properties(GtkBox* box)
{
  gtk_object_set(GTK_OBJECT(box), "homogeneous", TRUE,
                                  "spacing", 8,
				  NULL);
}
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>


@object: the object whose arguments should be set.
@first_arg_name: the name of the first argument to set.
@Varargs: the value of the first argument, followed optionally
by more name/value pairs, followed by NULL.

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_setv ##### -->
<para>
Set an array of arguments.
</para>

@object: the object whose arguments should be set.
@n_args: the number of arguments to set.
@args: the desired values, as an array of #GtkArgs (which contain 
the names, types, and values of the arguments).


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_query_args ##### -->
<para>
Get all the arguments that may be used for a given type.
</para>
<para>
In Java, this type of mechanism is called 
<wordasword>introspection</wordasword>.  It is used by applications
like Glade, that have to determine what can be done to an object
at run-time.
</para>

@class_type: the GtkType of the ObjectClass
(returned from GTK_OBJECT_CLASS(class)-&gt;type for example).
@arg_flags: if non-NULL, obtains the #GtkArgFlags that apply to
each argument.  You must g_free() this if you request it.
@n_args: the number of arguments is returned in this field.
@Returns: an array of arguments, that you must deallocate with g_free().


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_data ##### -->
<para>
Each object carries around a table of associations from
strings to pointers.  This function lets you set an association.
</para>
<para>
If the object already had an association with that name,
the old association will be destroyed.
</para>

@object: object containing the associations.
@key: name of the key.
@data: data to associate with that key.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_data_full ##### -->
<para>
Like gtk_object_set_data() except it adds notification
for when the association is destroyed, either by
gtk_object_remove_data() or when the object is destroyed.
</para>

@object: object containing the associations.
@key: name of the key.
@data: data to associate with that key.
@destroy: function to call when the association is destroyed.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_remove_data ##### -->
<para>
Remove a specified datum from the object's data associations (the object_data).
Subsequent calls to gtk_object_get_data() will return NULL.
</para>
<para>
If you specified a destroy handler with gtk_object_set_data_full(),
it will be invoked.
</para>


@object: the object maintaining the association.
@key: name of the key for that association.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_get_data ##### -->
<para>
Get a named field from the object's table of associations (the object_data).
</para>

@object: the object maintaining the associations.
@key: name of the key for that association.
@Returns: the data if found, or NULL if no such data exists.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_remove_no_notify ##### -->
<para>
Remove a specified datum from the object's data associations (the object_data),
without invoking the association's destroy handler.
</para>
<para>
Just like gtk_object_remove_data() except that any destroy handler
will be ignored.
Therefore this only affects data set using gtk_object_set_data_full().
</para>

@object: the object maintaining the association.
@key: name of the key for that association.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_user_data ##### -->
<para>
For convenience, every object offers a generic user data
pointer.  The function set it.
</para>
<para>
This function is equivalent to:
<informalexample>
<programlisting>
	gtk_object_set_data(object, "user_data", data);
</programlisting>
</informalexample>
</para>

@object: the object whose user data should be set.
@data: the new value for the user data.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_get_user_data ##### -->
<para>
Get the object's user data pointer.
</para>
<para>
This is intended to be a pointer for your convenience in
writing applications.
</para>

@object: the object.
@Returns: the user data field for object.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_class_add_signals ##### -->

@arg_flags: bitwise-OR of the #GtkArgFlags enum.  (Whether the argument is
settable or gettable, whether it is set when the object is constructed.)
@arg_id: an internal number, passed in from here to the "set_arg" and
"get_arg" handlers of the object.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_object_set_data_by_id ##### -->
<para>
Just like gtk_object_set_data() except that it takes
a #GQuark instead of a string, so it is slightly faster.
</para>
<para>
Use gtk_object_data_try_key() and gtk_object_data_force_id()
to get an id from a string.

<!-- ##### MACRO gtk_object_data_try_key ##### -->
<para>
Sees whether a certain quark exists.
Returns that quark if so.
</para>
<para>
Although this is currently the same as g_quark_try_string(),
it might someday be different, for example, if GQuarks
and object data are converted to separate mechanisms,
so it is good to use this macro.
</para>

</para>
<para>
Although this is currently the same as g_quark_from_string(),

</para>

@object: object to reference or unreference.
@func: name of caller's function to print (used within macros).
@dummy: unused.
@line: line number (used within macros).
@do_ref: whether to reference or unreference.


<!-- ##### SIGNAL GtkObject::destroy ##### -->
<para>
Indicates that an object is being destroyed.
</para>

@object: the object which received the signal.

<!-- ##### ARG GtkObject:user_data ##### -->
<para>
A pointer for convenience when programming applications.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkObject:signal ##### -->
<para>
Setting this with a GtkType of GTK_TYPE_SIGNAL connects
the signal to the object.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkObject:signal_after ##### -->
<para>
Setting this with a GtkType of GTK_TYPE_SIGNAL connects
the signal to the object, so that the signal is always run
after other user handlers and the default handler.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkObject:object_signal ##### -->
<para>
Setting this with a GtkType of GTK_TYPE_SIGNAL connects
the signal to the object, so that the user data and objects
and swapped when the signal handler is invoked.
</para>
<para>
This is useful for handlers that are primarily notifying
other objects and could just invoke an already existing function
if the parameters were swapped.
See gtk_signal_connect_object() for more details.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkObject:object_signal_after ##### -->
<para>
Setting this with a GtkType of GTK_TYPE_SIGNAL connects
the signal to the object, so that the user data and objects
and swapped when the signal handler is invoked,
and so that the handler is invoked after all others.
</para>
<para>
See gtk_signal_connect_object_after() for more details.
