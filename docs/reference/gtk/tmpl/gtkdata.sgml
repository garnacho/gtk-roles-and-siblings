GtkData

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
abstract base class for objects containing data.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The #GtkData object is a very simple object intended to be used as a base
class for objects which contain data (i.e. the 'Model' in the object-oriented
Model/View/Controller framework).
</para>
<para>
Currently it is not very useful since all it provides is a "disconnect" signal.
This signal could be emitted by a #GtkData subclass to notify any 'Views'
that they should disconnect from the #GtkData (the 'Model'), possibly just
before the #GtkData is destroyed.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GtkData ##### -->

<!-- ##### SIGNAL GtkData::disconnect ##### -->
<para>
Emitted to notify any views on the #GtkData object to disconnect from it,
possibly because the #GtkData object is about to be destroyed.
</para>

@data: the object which received the signal.
