<para>
GtkPaned is the base class for widgets with two panes,
arranged either horizontally (#GtkHPaned) or
vertically (#GtkVPaned). Child widgets are 
added to the panes of the widget with
gtk_paned_pack1() and gtk_paned_pack2(). The division
beween the two children is set by default from the
size requests of the children, but it can be adjusted
by the user.
</para>
<para>
A paned widget draws a separator between the two
child widgets and a small handle that the user
can drag to adjust the division. It does not
draw any relief around the children or around
the separator. (The space in which the separator
is called the gutter). Often, it is useful
to put each child inside a #GtkFrame with the
shadow type set to %GTK_SHADOW_IN so that the
gutter appears as a ridge.
</para>
<para>
Each child has two options that can be set, 
@resize and @shrink. If @resize is true, then when the
#GtkPaned is resized, that child will expand
or shrink along with the paned widget. If @shrink
is true, then when that child can be made smaller
than it's requisition by the user. Setting @shrink
to FALSE allows the application to set a minimum
size. If @resize is false for both children, then
this is treated as if @resize is true for both
children.
</para>
<para>
The application can set the position of the slider
as if it were set by the user, by calling
gtk_paned_set_position().
