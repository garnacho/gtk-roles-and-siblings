<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
GtkLabel

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
A widget that displays a small to medium amount of text.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The #GtkLabel widget is usually used directly by the programmer to display
word(s) describing an adjacent widget or its use.  It is also used internally
by Gtk+ as #GtkButton labels, #GtkMenu items, and many other widgets which
use text.
</para>

<!-- ##### SECTION See_Also ##### -->

</para>

<!-- ##### STRUCT GtkLabel ##### -->
<para>
This should not be accessed directly.  Use the accessor functions as
described below.
</para>


<!-- ##### STRUCT GtkLabelWord ##### -->
<para>
Internal to #GtkLabel.
</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_new ##### -->
<para>
Creates a new label with the given string of text inside it.  You can
pass NULL to get an empty label widget.
</para>

@str: The string you want to display in the #GtkLabel
@Returns: The newly allocated #GtkLabel widget


<!-- ##### MACRO gtk_label_set ##### -->
<para>
Aliases gtk_label_set_text.  Probably used for backward compatibility with
Gtk+ 1.0.x.
</para>



<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_set_pattern ##### -->
<para>
The pattern of underlines you want under the existing text within the
#GtkLabel widget.  For example if the current text of the label says
&quot;FooBarBaz&quot; passing a pattern of &quot;___   ___&quot; will underline
&quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;Baz&quot; but not &quot;Bar&quot;.
</para>

@label: The #GtkLabel you want to set the pattern to.
@pattern: The pattern as described above.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_set_justify ##### -->
<para>
Set where the text within the #GtkLabel will align to.  This can be one of
four values: GTK_JUSTIFY_LEFT, GTK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT, GTK_JUSTIFY_CENTER,
and GTK_JUSTIFY_FILL.  GTK_JUSTIFY_CENTER is the default value when the
widget is first created with gtk_label_new().
</para>

@label: The #GtkLabel widget you want to set justification for.
@jtype: The #GtkJustification type as described above.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_get ##### -->
<para>
Gets the current string of text within the #GtkLabel and writes it to
the given str argument.  It does not make a copy of this string so you
must not write to it.
</para>

@label: The #GtkLabel widget you want to get the text from.
@str: The reference to the pointer you want to point to the text.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_parse_uline ##### -->
<para>
Parses the given string for underscores and converts the next
character to an underlined character.  The last character that
was underlined will have its lower-cased accelerator keyval returned  (i.e.
&quot;_File&quot; would return the keyval for &quot;f&quot;.  This is
probably only used within the Gtk+ library itself for menu items and such.
</para>

@label: The #GtkLabel you want to affect.
@string: The string you want to parse for underlines.
@Returns: The lowercase keyval of the last character underlined.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_set_line_wrap ##### -->
<para>
Toggles line wrapping within the #GtkLabel widget.  TRUE makes it break
lines if text exceeds the widget's size.  FALSE lets the text get cut off
by the edge of the widget if it exceeds the widget size.
</para>

@label: The #GtkLabel you want to set line wrapping for.
@wrap: TRUE turns it on; FALSE turns it off.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gtk_label_set_text ##### -->
<para>
Sets the text within the #GtkLabel widget.  It overwrites any text that
was there before.  Note that underlines that were there before do not
get overwritten.  If you want to erase underlines just send NULL to
gtk_label_set_pattern().
</para>

@label: The #GtkLabel you want to set the text for.
@str: The text you want to add.


<!-- ##### ARG GtkLabel:label ##### -->
<para>
The actual label text.  Do not write to this pointer, it is not copied.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkLabel:pattern ##### -->
<para>
The pattern of underlines under the existing text.  Do not change the
pointer, it isn't copied.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkLabel:justify ##### -->
<para>
The #GtkJustification setting.  See gtk_label_set_justify() for more info.
</para>

<!-- ##### ARG GtkLabel:wrap ##### -->
<para>

</para>
