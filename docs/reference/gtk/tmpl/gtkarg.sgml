Utility function to manipulate lists of named, typed arguments.

All the functions in here are marked a Non-public.
We describe it anyway because it is occasionally useful
to understand how the work is done.

<para>
Arguments are a way of describing a named parameter to a function.
They have two important roles within gtk+:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
they describe <wordasword>object properties</wordasword>.
This means that they present an interface to get and set a named-type
for any type of object in a consistent way.
(All the relevant functions to do this start with gtk_object_set
or gtk_object_get).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
they describe <wordasword>signal arguments</wordasword>.
This is a lot less often needed but still useful.
Usually if you are just emitting or creating a particular signal
it is more convenient to just use gtk_signal_emit() or gtk_signal_new().
However if you are writing a function to emit or create an arbitrary
signal, you must use gtk_signal_emitv() or gtk_signal_newv().
