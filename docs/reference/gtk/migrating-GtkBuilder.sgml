  <title>Migrating from libglade to GtkBuilder</title>

  <para>
    Since version 2.12, GTK+ provides #GtkBuilder to construct
    user interfaces from XML descriptions, similar to the functionality
    provided by #GladeXML in the libglade library.

    While GtkBuilder strives to be a complete replacement for
    libglade, there are a number of areas where it is currently
    still behind libglade:
    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>
        GtkBuilder can not construct partial trees, it lacks
        the equivalent of the @root parameter of glade_xml_new().
        Due to the way GtkBuilder parses its input, this is difficult 
        to implement, see 
        <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=447998">bug 
        447998</ulink>. As a workaround, you can split your glade file 
        into multiple GtkBuilder input files. The 
        <application>gtk-builder-convert</application> conversion script 
        has a <option>--root</option> option that can help with this.
      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>
        GtkBuilder does not yet implement support for accessibility 
        properties. It parses the same &lt;accessibility&gt; elements 
        as libglade, but ignores them. See 
        <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454653">bug 
        454983</ulink> for the current status of accessibility support 
        in GtkBuilder.
      </para></listitem>
 
      <listitem><para>
        GtkBuilder supports context information in translatable
        properties in a slightly different way than libglade. 
        Intltool does not yet support this; see 
        <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=454894">bug 
        454894</ulink> for the current status of intltool support for 
        GtkBuilder files. Thankfully, context in translations is a 
        rarely used feature, and if you are not using it, intltools 
        glade format support works just fine for GtkBuilder files.
