	* gdk/tmpl/gcs.sgml gdk/gdk-sections.txt: Added section. 
	  (Written a while ago but fell through the cracks)

	* gtk/gtk-docs.sgml: Add a &hash; entity here as a
	  temporary hack. (There is no standard entity
	  for '#', and no way of escaping '#' in gtk-doc)

	* gtk/tmpl/gtkrc.sgml: Use the above to fix up #rrggbb
	  string literals.

	* gtk/tmpl/gtkdrawingarea.sgml: Fixed a couple
	  of errors in the example. (pointed out by
	  Nick Lamb)

	* gdk/tmpl/properties.sgml
	  gdk/tmpl/selections.sgml
	  gdk/tmpl/input_devices.sgml: Documented

	* gdk/gdk-sections.txt: Moved around types for
	  input devices properties and selections, marked
	  a few functions as private.
