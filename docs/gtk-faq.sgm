	<title>What is GTK+?</title>
	<para>GTK+ is a small and efficient widget set designed with
	the general look and feel of Motif.  In reality, it looks much
	better than Motif.  It contains common widgets and some more
	complex widgets such as a file selection, and color selection
	widgets.</para>
	<para>GTK+ provides some unique features. (At least, I know of
	no other widget library which provides them). For example, a
	button does not contain a label, it contains a child widget,
	which in most instances will be a label.  However, the child
	widget can also be a pixmap, image or any combination possible
	the programmer desires. This flexibility is adhered to
	throughout the library.</para>
      </sect2>

      <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------- -->

      <sect2>
	<title>What is the + in GTK+?</title>
	<para>Peter Mattis informed the gtk mailing list that:</para>
	<para><quote>I originally wrote gtk which included the three
	libraries, libglib, libgdk and libgtk. It featured a flat
	widget hierarchy. That is, you couldn't derive a new widget
	from an existing one. And it contained a more standard
	callback mechanism instead of the signal mechanism now present
	in gtk+. The + was added to distinguish between the original
	version of gtk and the new version. You can think of it as
	being an enhancement to the original gtk that adds object
	oriented features.</quote></para>

	<title>Where is the documentation for GTK+?</title>
	<para>In the GTK+ distribution's doc/ directory you will find

	GTK Tutorial.</para>
	<para>In addition, you can find links to HTML versions of

	<title>Is there a mailing list (or mailing list archive) for

	<title>How to get help with GTK+</title>
	<para>First, make sure your question isn't answered in the
	documentation, this FAQ or the tutorial. Done that? You're
	sure you've done that, right? In that case, the best place to
	post questions is to the GTK+ mailing list.</para>

	<title>How to report bugs in GTK+</title>
	<para>Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system
	(<ulink
	url="http://bugs.gnome.org">http://bugs.gnome.org</ulink>). To
	report a problem about GTK+, send mail to submit@bugs.gnome.org.</para>
	<para>The subject of the mail should describe your problem. In
	the body of the mail, you should first include a
	"pseudo-header" that gives the package and version
	number. This should be separated by a blank line from the
	actual headers.</para>

	<para><literallayout><literal>Package: gtk+</literal>
	<literal>Version: 1.2.0</literal></literallayout></para>

	<para>Substitute 1.2.0 with the version of GTK+ that you have installed.</para>
	<para>Then describe the bug. Include:</para>
	
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><simpara> Information about your system. For instance:</simpara>
	    <itemizedlist spacing=compact>
	      <listitem><simpara> What operating system and version</simpara>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem><simpara> What version of X</simpara>

	      <listitem><simpara> For Linux, what version of the C library</simpara>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	    <para>And anything else you think is relevant.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><simpara> How to reproduce the bug.</simpara>
	    <simpara>If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program
	    that is built in the gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most
	    convenient. Otherwise, please include a short test program
	    that exhibits the behavior. As a last resort, you can also
	    provide a pointer to a larger piece of software that can
	    be downloaded.</simpara>
	    <simpara>(Bugs that can be reproduced within the GIMP are
	    almost as good as bugs that can be reproduced in
	    testgtk. If you are reporting a bug found with the GIMP,
	    please include the version number of the GIMP you are
	    using)</simpara>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><simpara> If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was
	  printed out when the crash occured.</simpara>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem><simpara> Further information such as stack traces
  may be useful, but are not necessary. If you do send a stack trace,
  and the error is an X error, it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running
  the test program with the <literal>--sync</literal> command line option.</simpara>
