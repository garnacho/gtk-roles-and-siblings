Incompatible Changes from GTK+-1.2 to GTK+-1.4:

- The gdk_time* functions have been removed. This functionality
  has been unused since the main loop was moved into GLib
  prior to 1.2. 

- The signature for GtkPrintFunc (used for gtk_item_factory_dump_items)
  has been changed to take a 'const gchar *' instead of 'gchar *', to
  match what we do for glib, and other similar cases.

- The detail arguments in the GtkStyleClass structure are now 'const gchar *'.

- gtk_paned_set_gutter_size() has been removed, since the small handle tab
  has been changed to include the entire area previously occupied by
  the gutter.
