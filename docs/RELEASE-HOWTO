How to do a GTK+ release?
=========================

Make sure you have Owen's special autoconf and libtool RPMs, available at:
http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/gtk/autotools/


0) Blow away your gtk+ directory, check a new version out
1) Update NEWS based on ChangeLog
2) Update version in configure.in, increase MICRO, interface and binary
age by 1. (Note that this is critical, a slip-up here will cause the soname
to change).
3) Add === Released 2.0.9 === at the top of the ChangeLog
4) make distcheck
5) Fix broken stuff found by 4) repeat
6) cvs commit; you'll have a bunch of po file changes, and maybe some
doc changes too
7) If 6) fails because someone else committed inbetween, curse, cvs up
fix conflicts and go to 4)
8) type 'cvs tag GTK_2_0_9' in the toplevel directory
9) You now have the tarball, and the CVS tag, now upload the tarball to
gnome.org and gtk.org
10) Go to the gnome-announce list archives, find the last announce message,
create a new message in the same form, replacing version numbers, commentary
at the top about "what this release is about" and the Summary of changes.
11) Send it to gnome-announce-list, gtk-list, gtk-app-devel-list and
gtk-devel-list.
