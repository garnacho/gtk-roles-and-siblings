How to do a GTK+ release?
=========================

Make sure you have Owen's special autoconf and libtool RPMs, available at:
http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/gtk/autotools/.

Also make sure you have the following packages installed (I used the RPM
package names from RedHat 8.0):
* gtk-doc
* linuxdoc-tools
* docbook-utils

Without those packages make distcheck will *not* pass.


0) Blow away your gtk+ directory, check a new version out
1) autogen and build it, make sure to enable docs.
2) Update NEWS based on ChangeLog
3) Update version in configure.in, increase MICRO, interface and binary
age by 1. (Note that this is critical, a slip-up here will cause the soname
to change).
4) Add === Released 2.0.x === at the top of the ChangeLog
5) make mydistcheck
6) Fix broken stuff found by 4) repeat
7) cvs commit; you'll have a bunch of po file changes, and maybe some
doc changes too (NOTE: be sure to use cvs with compression, else you'll
end up waiting for a long time :).
8) If 7) fails because someone else committed inbetween, curse, cvs up
fix conflicts and go to 5)
9) type 'cvs tag GTK_2_0_9' in the toplevel directory
10) You now have the tarball, and the CVS tag, now upload the tarball to
gnome.org and gtk.org
11) Go to the gnome-announce list archives, find the last announce message,
create a new message in the same form, replacing version numbers, commentary
at the top about "what this release is about" and the Summary of changes.
12) Send it to gnome-announce-list, gtk-list, gtk-app-devel-list and
gtk-devel-list. Set reply-to to gnome-hackers.
