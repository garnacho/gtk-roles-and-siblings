Incompatible Changes from GTK+-1.0 to GTK+-1.2:

* GtkAcceleratorTable has been replaced with GtkAccelGroup

* GtkMenuFactory has been replaced with GtkItemFactory, although
  a version of GtkMenuFactory is provided to ease compatibility.

* GtkButton has been changed to derive from GtkBin. 
 
 To access a button's child, use GTK_BIN (button)->child, instead
 of the old GTK_BUTTON (button)->child.

* The selection API has been slightly modified:

 gtk_selection_add_handler() and gtk_selection_add_handler_full() 
 have been removed. To supply the selection, one now register
 the targets one is interested in with:

  void gtk_selection_add_target (GtkWidget           *widget, 
	  	                 GdkAtom              selection,
			         GdkAtom              target,
			         guint                info);

 or:
  
  void gtk_selection_add_targets (GtkWidget           *widget, 
	  			  GdkAtom              selection,
				  GtkTargetEntry      *targets,
				  guint                ntargets);

 When a request for a selection is received, the new "selection_get"
 signal will be called:

   void  "selection_get"           (GtkWidget          *widget,
				    GtkSelectionData   *selection_data,
				    guint               info,
				    guint               time);

 A "time" parameter has also been added to the "selection_received"
 signal.

  void  "selection_received"       (GtkWidget          *widget,
				    GtkSelectionData   *selection_data,
				    guint               time);

* The old drag and drop API has been completely removed and replaced.
  See the reference documentation for details on the new API.
