This is GTK+ version 1.3.9. GTK+, which stands for the Gimp ToolKit, 
is a library for creating graphical user interfaces for the X Window 
System. It is designed to be small, efficient, and flexible. GTK+ is

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system. 
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gtk+.) You will need
to create an account for yourself.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built 
  in the gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error
  is an X error, it will be more useful if the stacktrace
  is produced running the test program with the --sync command
  line option.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the
patch fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment
to that bug report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch,
and attach the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword
in their keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK
programming interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU
diff.)
