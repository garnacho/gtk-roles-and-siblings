General Information
===================

This is GTK+ version 2.4.1. GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for
creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets,
GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off projects to
complete application suites.

GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the
licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all
developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any
license fees or royalties.

Release notes
=============

* The new GtkFileChooser widget emphasizes simplicity and thus does 
  not provide a navigation entry by default when opening files. 
  Experienced command line users will likely want to make heavy use of
  the location dialog brought up by the Control-L key shortcut.

* As compared to GTK+-1.2, the default configuration of GTK+-2 has been 
  stream-lined to reduce confusion on the part of new users or users 
  coming from other environments.  Users used to older versions of 
  GTK+ may want to make some adjustments to the default configuration.

   - Emacs keybindings such as Control-A and Control-E to move to the
     ends of lines are not enabled by default in the editing widgets. To
     turn on Emacs keybindings, add the line:

      gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"
   
     To your ~/.gtkrc-2.0

   - Editing of menu accelerators by pressing an accelerator over the
     menu item is disabled by default. To enable, it, add:

      gtk-can-change-accels = 1

     to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0

   - To improve useability for keyboard operation, GTK+ now selects the
     contents of an entry when tabbing into it or when it is focused on
     initial window map. To disable this behavior, add:

      gtk-entry-select-on-focus = 0
 
     to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0

* The GTK+ libraries use an '_' prefix to indicate private symbols that
  must not be used by applications. On some platforms, symbols beginning 
  with prefixes such as _gtk, _gdk, and _pango will be exported
  from the library, on others not. In no case can applications
  use these private symbols.

* GTK+-2.4 now requires version 2 of Xft; old fashioned core X
  fonts are no longer supported.

* There is a bug in the Xft library in XFree86-4.1 and possibly previous
  versions that causes random crashes when using the Pango Xft
  backend. If you want to use Xft fonts, you should upgrade to
  at least XFree86-4.2.

* The gdk_pixbuf_xlib library included in the contrib/ directory of GTK+
  is provided on a as-is basis and has not been tested at all. No
  guarantees about the degree of workingness or about future
  compatibility are provided.

* While efforts have been made to make gdk-pixbuf robust against
  invalid images, using gdk-pixbuf to load untrusted data 
  is not recommended, due to the likelyhood that there are
  additional problems where an invalid image could cause
  gdk-pixbuf to crash or worse.

* The assumption of GLib and GTK+ by default is that filenames on the
  filesystem are encoded in UTF-8 rather than the encoding of the locale;
  the GTK+ developers consider that having filenames whose interpretation
  depends on the current locale is fundamentally a bad idea.

  If you have filenames encoded in the encoding of your locale, then
  you may want to set the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable:
  
   G_FILENAME_ENCODING=@local
   export G_FILENAME_ENCODING

  (Earlier versions of GLib-2.x required a different environment variable
  setting; G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=1 to achieve the same effect; this 
  is still supported, but G_FILENAME_ENCODING is preferred.)
  Best integration of GTK+-2.4 with the environment is achieved by 
  using a UTF-8 locale.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gtk+.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built in the
  gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, please
  include a short test program that exhibits the behavior.  As a last
  resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software
  that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
