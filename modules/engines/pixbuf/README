The code in this directory is a GTK+ theme engine based on the earlier
pixmap theme engine.

The config files are meant to be compatible, but instead of rendering
using Imlib, it renders using GdkPixbuf.  This makes the memory
management much more understandable, and also allows us to use
GdkPixbuf's high quality scaling.

Most of the code was reworked/rewritten in the process to make it more
understandable and maintainable.

There are lots of bugs here, a considersable number of bugs. But it's
cleaned up a great deal from the older pixmap engine. Please don't
make it uglier again.
