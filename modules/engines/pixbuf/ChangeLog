2001-03-05  Michael Natterer  <mitch@gimp.org>

	* src/pixbuf-draw.c: made the "parent_class" pointer static.

	(Owen, I just commented out the draw methods which don't exist any
	more to make it compile).

2001-02-20  Sven Neumann  <sven@convergence.de>

	* src/pixbuf-draw.c (draw_vline): use draw_vline method of 
	parent_class, not draw_hline

Wed Nov 15 21:56:28 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* src/pixbuf-*: A few updates for GTypePlugin.

Tue Jul 18 12:13:19 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

        Updates to work with GTK+-2.0 theme engine architecture.
	It won't even sort of work with GTK+-1.2 any more.

	* configure.in src/Makefile.am: Look for GTK+-2.0, 
	install engine into GTK+-2.0 location.
	
	* src/pixbuf-style.h src/pixbuf-rc-style.[ch]: New
	files for GtkRcStyle and GtkStyle subclasses. Parsing,
	etc, moves to pixbuf-rc-style.[ch]

	* src/pixbuf-draw.c: Chain up to parent implementation
	when images aren't found for a certain element.

Sun Jul  9 18:15:58 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	using gdk_rectangle_intersect() from GTK+-1.2.

	direct access to pixbuf internals.

Mon Mar  6 11:44:58 2000  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	automakify

	src/pixbuf-main.c: Move sources into subdir and
	rename.

	* pixmap_theme_pixbuf.c: Handle drawing transparency without a
	mask correctly.

========== ChangeLog for pixmap engine ===================

1999-11-22  Martin Baulig  <martin@home-of-linux.org>

	* pixmap_theme_main.c (theme_duplicate_style): Really copy the
	`src_data->img_list', not just the pointer that points to it.

Tue Oct  5 15:13:29 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_draw.c (apply_theme_image): Don't set
	background pixmap on pixmaps.

1999-02-14  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Theme/gtk/Makefile.am.in (Makefile.am): Handle the case when
	files are deleted.

Thu Feb 11 21:16:53 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_main.c (theme_data_unref): Free the
	theme data structure as well as the contents.

1999-02-03  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Theme/gtk/Makefile.am.in: New file.  Theme/gtk/Makefile.am is
	generated from this file when new *.png files are added.

1999-01-23  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* pixmap_theme_main.c (theme_init): Turn on pixmap cache. 

Mon Jan 18 13:37:23 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* Theme/gtk/gtkrc: Give buttons a gray background
	color so they look a little less funny when initially
	drawing.

Wed Jan 13 18:58:25 1999  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_draw.c: Fixed pervasive mis-bracketing
	that was causing drawing if the drawn region and
	clipping region did NOT intersect, and a couple
	of errors in computing source and destination 
	regions.

1998-11-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* pixmap_theme_draw.c: #include <math.h>

1998-11-07  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Theme/gtk/Makefile.am (theme_DATA): 
	Update to new directory contents.
	* configure.in: Remove.

Fri Nov  6 17:26:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_main.c: Removed some debugging 
	printf's. 

	* Theme/gtk/notebook1.c Theme/gtk/menubar.png: new
	bigger pixmaps to reduce pixelation.

	* Theme/gtk/gtkrc: Reorganized to use several styles
	instead of one huge style. Change clist backgrounds
	to be prettier.

Thu Nov  5 10:23:46 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_draw.c (draw_shadow_gap): Fixed hard-coded
	gap_side of '0'.

Mon Nov  2 14:46:02 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_draw.c (apply_theme_image_shadow_gap): Removed
	several hundred lines of duplicated code with a bit of
	reoriganization.

Wed Oct 28 16:18:04 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@redhat.com>

	* pixmap_theme_main.c (theme_symbols): Removed lots
	and lots of white space.
