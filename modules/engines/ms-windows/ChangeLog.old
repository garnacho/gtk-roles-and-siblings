	* === Released 0.5.0 ===
	
2003-10-07  Raymond Penners  <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	* src/wimp_style.c: Tabs not located on top of the notebook are
	now (again) no longer rendered using XP theming.
	
	* src/xp_theme.c: Added a more lightweight method to cope with
	theme changes. Added a crude theme switch detection scheme in the
	case that GTK+ does not implement gdk_window_add_filter properly
	(GTK+ 2.2.0?).
	
2003-10-07  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	theme and color changes as they're too experimental
	
	* src/wimp_style.[ch]: Export some things, make them accept 0 args

2003-10-03  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	* src/wimp_style.c wimp_style_main.c: Refactor how we're doing

2003-10-03  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

2003-10-01  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	* src/wimp_style.c: Only set the delays if the param is

	recent tree expander changes, not the clipping area. Fixed.
	
	* src/xp_theme.c: Re-enabled clipping area, I am confident it
	should not cause any problems now.
	
2003-09-18  Raymond Penners  <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	* === Released 0.4.2 ===
	
2003-09-16  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

2003-09-15  Raymond Penners  <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	* === Released 0.4.1 ===
	
	* src/wimp_style.c: Fixed typ-o (gtk-double-cliNk-time), adjusted
	cursor blink time to cope with Windows semantics (GTK+ uses cycle
	time), fixed clipping area computation. Fixed XP tree expanders to
	cope with clipping area, and made non-XP tree expanders look
	pixel-perfect.

	* src/wimp_style.c: Fix a few more console messages, implement
	caret blinking
	
	* src/xp_theme.*: Stub out line drawing. Apparently, documented

2003-09-14  Raymond Penners  <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	* src/wimp_style.c: Fixed console message complaining about
	"default_border".

	* src/*.c: Theme GTK toolbar arrows to XP chevrons, once my GTK
	patch is committed.
	
	* src/wimp_style.c: Enable proper fonts/sizes for menus, status
	bars. Tooltips are waiting for my GTK patches, though.

2003-08-28  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	* src/wimp_style.c: Change how we draw handle boxes in the non-XP
	case. This does not yet apply to GtkHandleBoxes
	
2003-08-26  Dom Lachowicz <cinamod@hotmail.com>

	* src/*.c: Tooltips should do XP-style theming. Handle Boxes/Panes
	do XP style REBAR theming (TODO: non-XP version of the above for
	handleboxes). Toolbars should draw the REBAR part
	properly. Preparation for using the Toolbar class. Menubars and
	Toolbars now are etched-in to mimic Windows'
	behavior. HandleBoxes' shadow types should also be correct now,
	compared to OfficeXP applications.
	
2003-08-26  Raymond Penners <raymond@dotsphinx.com>
	
	* === Released 0.3.0 ===
	
2003-08-23  Raymond Penners <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	progress bars nicely adhere to the system colors as well.

	* src/xp_theme.c: There was a mixup in drawing the proper checkbox
	state, fixed (Gaim bug #790305).

2003-08-20  Raymond Penners <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	* src/Theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc: Disabled the colored, alternating
	rules for GtkTreeViews to match the Windows behaviour.

	* */Makefile.msc: Provided MS-VC++ make files.
	
	* src/xp_theme.c: The open/close tree expander symbols were
	accidentally switched, fixed (Gaim bug #790300).

2003-08-11  Raymond Penners <raymond@dotsphinx.com>

	* src/wimp_style.c: The menu background color now follows XP's
