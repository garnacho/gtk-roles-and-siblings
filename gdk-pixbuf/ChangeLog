1999-07-29  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/io-png.c (image_save): Added PNG saving function

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c: Changed image_save function format.  Now it's
	image_save(GdkPixBuf *p, FILE *f, ...)
	

1999-07-26  Michael Zucchi  <mzucchi@denr.sa.gov.au>

	* src/Makefile.am (*_LIB): Only build the relevant loaders which
	require extra libraries if we actually have those libraries.

1999-07-23  Richard Hestilow  <hestgray@ionet.net>
	
	* src/gdk-pixbuf.h: Include glib.h as it uses g* datatypes
	* gdk_pixbufConf.sh.in: Added for gnome-config
	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in: Modified to generate gdk_pixbufConf.sh

1999-07-20  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_rotate): Fixed rotation.  Now a bbox
	calculation needs to be done.

1999-07-18  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/io-xpm.c:
	* src/io-gif.c:
	* src/io-png.c:
	* src/io-jpeg.c: Fix a few memory leaks in the, most of them in
	error cases but one or two in the common case.  There are probably
	a few small ones left.
	
1999-07-18  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed version.h. 

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c (pixbuf_check_tiff): Minor readability
	improvements.

1999-07-17  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c: Removed gdk_pixbuf_free, redundant code.
	(gdk_pixbuf_rotate): Added pixbuf rotation code.
	(gdk_pixbuf_scale): Changed // comments to /* */

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.h (gdk_pixbuf_destroy): Added gdk_pixbuf_destroy
	function to header.

1999-07-16  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/testpixbuf.c (expose_func): reverted the expose everything
	changes, I'm not sure why these went in.
	(config_func): bring this up to date with the new pixbuf_scale
	semantics.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c: added a couple of warnings to the module
	loading code so that poeple can diagnose problems better. 

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbux_scale): fix the borkedness, also it
	no longer allocates a new pixbuf, which make things nicer for the
	rest of the code.  Unfortunately there is still a problem with
	scaling rgba images.

1999-07-16  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/testpixbuf.c (config_func): ConfigureEvent handler.  This
	calls gdk_pixbuf_scale.  However, something is not working.
	N.B.: current pixmap is now stored in user_data with a key of
	"pixmap"

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_scale): Implemented scaling function.
	Something is still borked, however.

1999-07-15  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/io-jpeg.c (image_load): add raph@gimp.org's fix to the jpeg
	indexing routine

	* src/testpixbuf.c (main): fix up the file routines a little so
	that you can load multiple files given the file names

1999-07-14  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/testpixbuf.c (expose_func): added an almost proper expose 
	handler for testpixbuf

1999-07-13  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: Fixed GIF check.  Replaced " with '
	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c: More (minor) work on gdk_pixbuf_scale

1999-07-13  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: I am a bonehead.  Added gif-lib check.
