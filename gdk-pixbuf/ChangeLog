1999-10-18  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Use $GTK_LIBS as the extra libs when checking for
	libgif/libungif, as they need the X libraries.  Fixes bug #2472.

1999-10-10  Cody Russell  <bratsche@dfw.net>
	* src/gdk-pixbuf-drawable.c: core function now determines whether
	the requested geometry is on screen or not, and if some is not
	then the request is clamped to geometry that is on the screen.

	Changed 'pixbuf' to 'art_pixbuf' in core function.

1999-10-08  Michael Fulbright  <drmike@redhat.com>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-data.c: Added to load rgb data from const data.

	* src/testpifbuf: Changed test program to display cdrom from rgb data
	if no filename given to test program.

1999-10-07  Cody Russell  <bratsche@dfw.net>
	* src/gdk-pixbuf-drawable.[ch]: Added. (Actually, Miguel committed
	them, but I wrote them).

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-drawable.h: Added a missing ; so things will now
	compile.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added gdk-pixbuf-drawable.[ch] to
	libgdk_pixbuf_la_SOURCES and libgdk_pixbufinclude_HEADERS.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-drawable.c: Added #include "gdk-pixbuf-drawable.h"
	to fix compilation.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-drawable.[ch]: Changed functions to return
	GdkPixBuf* instead of ArtPixBuf*.

1999-09-22  Michael Meeks  <michael@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_new): created.
	(gdk_pixbuf_scale): use gdk_pixbuf_new + return a new scaled image.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.h (struct _GdkPixBuf): Re-organise struct, + add
	GdkPixBufUnrefFunc + gdk_pixbuf_new.

	* src/io-jpeg.c (image_load): clean to use gdk_pixbuf_new.

	* src/io-xpm.c (_pixbuf_create_from_xpm): ditto.

	* src/io-tiff.c (image_load): ditto + fix leak

	* src/io-png.c (image_load): ditto + add more exit points; monitor.png
	crashes this module ( add warning :-)

	* src/io-bmp.c (image_load): ditto.

	* src/io-gif.c (image_load): ditto.

1999-09-18  Michael Meeks  <michael@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_scale): Hack rgba support in so
	it doesn't crash scaling with alpha.

1999-09-17  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@redhat.com>

	* src/io-bmp.c (image_load): Set the initial ref_count to 1.

	* src/io-gif.c (image_load): Likewise.

	* src/io-jpeg.c (image_load): Likewise.

	* src/io-png.c (image_load): Likewise.

	* src/io-tiff.c (image_load): Likewise.

	* src/io-xpm.c (_pixbuf_create_from_xpm): Likewise.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c (gdk_pixbuf_load_image): Added an assertion
	for the ref_count to be != 0.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_ref): Be more paranoid with sanity
	checking.
	(gdk_pixbuf_unref): Fix incorrect sanity check and comparison.

1999-08-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* src/io-png.c (image_save): Fixed compiler warnings.  Fixed write
	to unallocated memory (row_ptr), and fixed its type as well.  Take
	into account the ArtPixbuf's rowstride when assigning the row
	pointers.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c: Fixup includes.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c: Likewise.

Sat Jul 31 19:19:47 CEST 1999

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c:
	* src/io-png.c: Fixed two obvious C syntax bugs

1999-07-29  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/io-png.c (image_save): Added PNG saving function

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c: Changed image_save function format.  Now it's
	image_save(GdkPixBuf *p, FILE *f, ...)
	

1999-07-26  Michael Zucchi  <mzucchi@denr.sa.gov.au>

	* src/Makefile.am (*_LIB): Only build the relevant loaders which
	require extra libraries if we actually have those libraries.

1999-07-23  Richard Hestilow  <hestgray@ionet.net>
	
	* src/gdk-pixbuf.h: Include glib.h as it uses g* datatypes
	* gdk_pixbufConf.sh.in: Added for gnome-config
	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.in: Modified to generate gdk_pixbufConf.sh

1999-07-20  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_rotate): Fixed rotation.  Now a bbox
	calculation needs to be done.

1999-07-18  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/io-xpm.c:
	* src/io-gif.c:
	* src/io-png.c:
	* src/io-jpeg.c: Fix a few memory leaks in the, most of them in
	error cases but one or two in the common case.  There are probably
	a few small ones left.
	
1999-07-18  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: removed version.h. 

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c (pixbuf_check_tiff): Minor readability
	improvements.

1999-07-17  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c: Removed gdk_pixbuf_free, redundant code.
	(gdk_pixbuf_rotate): Added pixbuf rotation code.
	(gdk_pixbuf_scale): Changed // comments to /* */

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.h (gdk_pixbuf_destroy): Added gdk_pixbuf_destroy
	function to header.

1999-07-16  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/testpixbuf.c (expose_func): reverted the expose everything
	changes, I'm not sure why these went in.
	(config_func): bring this up to date with the new pixbuf_scale
	semantics.

	* src/gdk-pixbuf-io.c: added a couple of warnings to the module
	loading code so that poeple can diagnose problems better. 

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbux_scale): fix the borkedness, also it
	no longer allocates a new pixbuf, which make things nicer for the
	rest of the code.  Unfortunately there is still a problem with
	scaling rgba images.

1999-07-16  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* src/testpixbuf.c (config_func): ConfigureEvent handler.  This
	calls gdk_pixbuf_scale.  However, something is not working.
	N.B.: current pixmap is now stored in user_data with a key of
	"pixmap"

	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c (gdk_pixbuf_scale): Implemented scaling function.
	Something is still borked, however.

1999-07-15  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/io-jpeg.c (image_load): add raph@gimp.org's fix to the jpeg
	indexing routine

	* src/testpixbuf.c (main): fix up the file routines a little so
	that you can load multiple files given the file names

1999-07-14  Larry Ewing  <lewing@gimp.org>

	* src/testpixbuf.c (expose_func): added an almost proper expose 
	handler for testpixbuf

1999-07-13  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: Fixed GIF check.  Replaced " with '
	* src/gdk-pixbuf.c: More (minor) work on gdk_pixbuf_scale

1999-07-13  Mark Crichton  <crichton@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: I am a bonehead.  Added gif-lib check.
