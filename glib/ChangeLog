Mon May 11 21:11:54 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* gutils.c gmessages.c: Moved g_error, g_warning, g_message and
	g_print from gutils.c to new file gmessages.c, to avoid having to
	include <unistd.h> in gutils.c which was causing problems for the
	g_strsignal implementation on FreeBSD boxes.

Mon May 11 09:53:43 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* configure.in: preserve automake CFLAGS.

	* Makefile.am: fully rename the created library to libglib-1.1.la.
	this means we need to change certain portions of the Makefile.am on
	major/minor version bumps.

	* ltmain.sh: the -release option is not required anymore.

        * glib.h: provide G_GNUC_FUNCTION and G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION to
	avoid conditionals. unconditionally define NULL, TRUE, FALSE, MAX,
	MIN, ABS and CLAMP, these macros might be screwed from other headers.

Mon May 11 01:44:10 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gdataset.c: new file, gdatasets implement the object data
	mechanism from GtkObject. a generic data pointer is associated with
	a certain location and a key id.

Sat May  9 20:08:12 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

        * glib/gmem.c: Experimentally restore GMemChunk
        to its primeval state - where mem areas are
        freed incrementally instead of searching the tree
        every time a mem area is completely empty. Also,
        always keep one mem chunk around. (Reduced calls
        to malloc() a lot, but doesn't really improve
        performance significiantly)

Thu May  7 08:17:28 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* glib.h (G_GNUC_PRINTF):
	(G_GNUC_SCANF): macros to facilitate the printf/scanf format argument
	checking of gcc.

	* gstring.c: const corrections, string!=NULL checks at function entry.
	(g_string_down): new function for tolower(3) conversion.
	(g_string_up): new function for toupper(3) conversion.

	* gutils.c: const corrections.
	(g_strdown): g_string_down() counterpart.
	(g_strup): g_string_up() counterpart.

	* gscanner.c (g_scanner_unexp_token):
 	(g_scanner_error):
	(g_scanner_warn): new functions to let a scanner put out warnings
 	or errors, especially to react on unexpected tokens.

	* gslist.c:
 	(g_slist_index): find out about about the position of a
	certain data pointer.
 	(g_slist_position): find out about about the position of a
	certain node.

	* glist.c:
 	(g_list_index): find out about about the position of a
	certain data pointer.

Thu May  7 05:14:19 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* ltmain.sh: added a new commandline flag -postfix similar to -release,
	but will immediately change the library name.

	* Makefile.am: specify -postfix and -version-info

	* configure.in: version bump to 1.1.0. added GLIB_INTERFACE_AGE and
	GLIB_BINARY_AGE. calculate LT_* variables for libtool.

Fri May  1 16:36:08 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* gutils.c: (g_strcasecmp). Check for isupper before
	taking tolower, and account for macroized tolower.

	* gutils.c (g_error): Check for recursion.

1998-04-27  Elliot Lee  <sopwith@cuc.ml.org>

	* glist.c (g_list_position): New function to find the position of
	a link in a list - should be the inverse of g_list_nth(), but
	haven't tested it so poof.

Thu Apr 30 21:41:30 1998  Owen Taylor  <otaylor@gtk.org>

	* gstring.c : Check arguments more carefully, 
	(gtk-draco-980423-1.patch; ramsey@rhrk.uni-kl.de) 

Tue Apr  7 19:36:48 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* gutils.c (g_direct_compare): Removed, because that's what
	a NULL comparison function means. And it wasn't 64 bit safe.

Mon Apr  6 18:43:25 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gscanner.c (g_scanner_get_token_ll): fixed a bug that caused floats
	of the format ".xxx" to be parsed as "xxx".

Fri Apr  3 20:36:35 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* gutils.c (g_parse_debug_string): Make debug string
	parsine case-insensitive

Fri Apr  3 17:03:18 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gstring.c: corrected possible overrun when inserting into

	to appease SGI compiler.
	
Thu Mar 26 20:47:21 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* configure.in glib glibconfig.h.in: Add test for atexit/on_exit -
	use on_exit if atexit not found in definition of ATEXIT.

Wed Mar 25 15:23:37 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Switched glibconfig.h rule from HEADERS
	to DATA, so that it is not added to DISTFILES

Sun Mar 15 07:13:34 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@gimp.org>

	* gutils.c: changed *_handler variables to be named glib_*_handler,
	so you can easily access them from gdb.

Sat Mar 14 17:47:43 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* Makefile.am: Don't refer to current directory as $(top_builddir)
	to avoid confusing non-gmakes

Sat Mar 14 01:37:35 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* Makefile.am (configincludedir): Moved glibconfig.h to
          $(pkglibdir)/include

	changed *_nth functions to take guint as argument.

	* glist.c: adapted g_list_length and g_list_length.

	* gslist.c: adapted g_slist_length and g_slist_length.

Mon Mar  2 17:51:18 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* glib.h gstring.c: Added g_string_insert[_c]()
	  and g_string_erase().

	  From: Stefan Wille  <1wille@vsys1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de>

Mon Feb 16 23:05:06 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* glist.c (g_list_insert_sorted): Changed function
	  so elements are always inserted, even if they compare
	  equal with another.

Thu Feb 12 22:48:11 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	  iswalnum can actually be used. (Not true for
	  Linux libc-5.4.38)

Sat Feb  7 11:48:09 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* gstring.c gutils.c: added some additional consts in
	  appropriate places to remove a warning

	* glib.h: list iterator macros now check for NULL pointers

Tue Jan 27 09:46:57 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gstring.c: g_string_prepend and g_string_prepend_c had
	interchanged src and dest parameters for g_memmove. Fixed.

Tue Jan 27 01:38:52 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gslist.c: fixed a really, really lame error. g_slist_insert
	didn't hook the data in! Reworked the routine to reflect the
	functionality of g_list

Wed Jan 21 01:13:25 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* Applied patch from (Raja R Harinath <harinath@cs.umn.edu>)

Fri Jan  9 20:03:46 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* gutils.c (g_strerror): changed message for EAGAIN from
	"no more processes" to "try again" since EAGAIN is used with
	functions else than fork().

	* gscanner.c (g_scanner_get_token_ll): use strtol() instead of
	strtoul() to avoid conflicts with solaris.

	* merged the glib portions from Jan 2 to Jan 7 out of gtk+/ChangeLog
 	into this file.

Wed Jan  7 02:14:30 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* glib_pre1.h: 
	* glib_pre2.h: 
	* glib.h: reverted glibconfig.h and glib.h files back to the
	way they were before my ugly hack.

	* gscanner.c: removed inlines from clist and gscanner

Tue Dec 23 02:49:51 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* gscanner.c: new file for GScanner: Flexible lexical scanner for
 	general purpose.
	* glib_pre2.h: added GScanner includes. added g_strconcat and g_strtod.
	gutils.c (g_strconcat): new function for string concatenation of NULL
 	terminated parameter list.
	(g_strtod): new function to perform best string to double conversion
	with or without consideration of the current locale.

Mon Dec 15 19:33:58 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* glist.c: minor optimizations:
 	(g_list_append): `if' optimized for common code path, commented out
 	unneccessary `assert', saved one variable assignment.
	(g_list_prepend): saved two (conditioned) variable assignment.
	(g_list_insert): saved one  (conditioned) variable assignment,
	saved one variable assignment.
	(g_list_remove): `if' optimized for common code path, saved two
	variable assignments by using `g_list_free_1' (which is even
 	faster) instead of `g_list_free'.
	(g_list_reverse): saved allocation of one variable, saved one
	variable assignment.

Wed Dec 10 23:27:20 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* glib_pre1.h: 
	* glib_pre2.h: 
	* glib.h: this file now gets concatenated by makeglib_h from
	glib_pre1.h and glib_pre2.h to merge in glibconfig.h wich got
	created by configure (done by Jay Painter).

	* glib_pre2.h: the g_assert*() and g_return_*_fail() macros
	are wrapped by G_STMT_START and G_STMT_END now, to avoid conflicts
	when used within if (...) g_macro(); else ... conditionals.
	
Tue Dec 17 13:14:07 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* glib.h: Changed 'g_return_if_fail' and 'g_return_val_if_fail' to
	not call 'g_string' but to simply stringify the
	expression. Calling 'g_string' causes the expression to be
	expanded which is undesired.

Sun Dec  1 01:30:48 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Started ChangeLog
