Wed Jan 28 23:53:27 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* glist.c
	* gslist.c
	* testglib.c: the sort functions compared backwards. Fixed
	* glib.h: list iterator macros now check for NULL pointers

Tue Jan 27 09:46:57 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gstring.c: g_string_prepend and g_string_prepend_c had
	interchanged src and dest parameters for g_memmove. Fixed.

Tue Jan 27 01:38:52 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* gslist.c: fixed a really, really lame error. g_slist_insert
	didn't hook the data in! Reworked the routine to reflect the
	functionality of g_list

Wed Jan 21 01:13:25 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* Applied patch from (Raja R Harinath <harinath@cs.umn.edu>)
	  to add function g_snprintf.
        * configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Check for vsnprintf.
        * glib.h: Add prototype for g_snprintf.
        * glibconfig.h.in: Add HAVE_VSNPRINTF.
        * gutils.c (g_snprintf): new function.

Sat Jan 17 23:52:40 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* gstring.{c,h} gscanner.c:
	   renamed g_string_equal => g_str_equal
	   renamed g_string_hash => g_str_hash
	  And const corrected. Old functions left in for now.
	
Fri Jan  9 20:03:46 1998  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* gutils.c (g_strerror): changed message for EAGAIN from
	"no more processes" to "try again" since EAGAIN is used with
	functions else than fork().

	* gscanner.c (g_scanner_get_token_ll): use strtol() instead of
	strtoul() to avoid conflicts with solaris.

	* merged the glib portions from Jan 2 to Jan 7 out of gtk+/ChangeLog
 	into this file.

Wed Jan  7 02:14:30 PST 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* glib.h:
	* glist.c:
	* gslist.c:
	* testglib.c: Added g_[s]list_insert_sorted function
	and appropriate tests in testglib

Sat Jan  3 20:23:25 1998  Owen Taylor  <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* glib.h: Changed guint32 -> guint for bitfields.
	(Bitfields must be int or unsigned int?)

Fri Jan  2 23:52 PST 1998 Jay Painter <jpaint@serv.net>

	* glib_pre1.h: 
	* glib_pre2.h: 
	* glib.h: reverted glibconfig.h and glib.h files back to the
	way they were before my ugly hack.

	* gscanner.c: removed inlines from clist and gscanner

Tue Dec 23 02:49:51 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* gscanner.c: new file for GScanner: Flexible lexical scanner for
 	general purpose.
	* glib_pre2.h: added GScanner includes. added g_strconcat and g_strtod.
	gutils.c (g_strconcat): new function for string concatenation of NULL
 	terminated parameter list.
	(g_strtod): new function to perform best string to double conversion
	with or without consideration of the current locale.

Mon Dec 15 19:33:58 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* glist.c: minor optimizations:
 	(g_list_append): `if' optimized for common code path, commented out
 	unneccessary `assert', saved one variable assignment.
	(g_list_prepend): saved two (conditioned) variable assignment.
	(g_list_insert): saved one  (conditioned) variable assignment,
	saved one variable assignment.
	(g_list_remove): `if' optimized for common code path, saved two
	variable assignments by using `g_list_free_1' (which is even
 	faster) instead of `g_list_free'.
	(g_list_reverse): saved allocation of one variable, saved one
	variable assignment.

Wed Dec 10 23:27:20 1997  Tim Janik  <timj@psynet.net>

	* glib_pre1.h: 
	* glib_pre2.h: 
	* glib.h: this file now gets concatenated by makeglib_h from
	glib_pre1.h and glib_pre2.h to merge in glibconfig.h wich got
	created by configure (done by Jay Painter).

	* glib_pre2.h: the g_assert*() and g_return_*_fail() macros
	are wrapped by G_STMT_START and G_STMT_END now, to avoid conflicts
	when used within if (...) g_macro(); else ... conditionals.
	
Tue Dec 17 13:14:07 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* glib.h: Changed 'g_return_if_fail' and 'g_return_val_if_fail' to
	not call 'g_string' but to simply stringify the
	expression. Calling 'g_string' causes the expression to be
	expanded which is undesired.

Sun Dec  1 01:30:48 1996  Peter Mattis  <pmattis@charnley.HIP.Berkeley.EDU>

	* Started ChangeLog
