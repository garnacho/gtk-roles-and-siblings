	* glist.c: minor optimizations:
 	(g_list_append): `if' optimized for common code path, commented out
 	unneccessary `assert', saved one variable assignment.
	(g_list_prepend): saved two (conditioned) variable assignment.
	(g_list_insert): saved one  (conditioned) variable assignment,
	saved one variable assignment.
	(g_list_remove): `if' optimized for common code path, saved two
	variable assignments by using `g_list_free_1' (which is even
 	faster) instead of `g_list_free'.
	(g_list_reverse): saved allocation of one variable, saved one
	variable assignment.

	* glib_pre1.h: 
	* glib_pre2.h: 
	* glib.h: this file now gets concatenated by makeglib_h from
	glib_pre1.h and glib_pre2.h to merge in glibconfig.h wich got
	created by configure (done by Jay Painter).

	* glib_pre2.h: the g_assert*() and g_return_*_fail() macros
	are wrapped by G_STMT_START and G_STMT_END now, to avoid conflicts
	when used within if (...) g_macro(); else ... conditionals.

	* glib.h: Changed 'g_return_if_fail' and 'g_return_val_if_fail' to
	not call 'g_string' but to simply stringify the
	expression. Calling 'g_string' causes the expression to be
	expanded which is undesired.
